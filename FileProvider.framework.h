/**
 Import a document.

 The file or package at fileURL should be moved on disk into the file provider's
 own storage, where it will later be uploaded.  The completion block should be
 executed after the move on disk, but before the upload.  Before doing any
 network, actually.

 In the completion block, importedDocumentItem should have these properties set:
   - itemIdentifier
   - parentItemIdentifier (to the value passed in to this method)
   - filename (to fileURL's resource value for key NSURLNameKey)
   - creationDate (to NSURLCreationDateKey)
   - contentModificationDate (to NSURLContentModificationDateKey)
   - typeIdentifier (to NSURLTypeIdentifierKey)
   - documentSize (to NSURLTotalFileSizeKey on a flat file, or to the sum of the
     files sizes for a package)
   - capabilities

 [fileURL startAccessingSecurityScopedResource] needs to be called prior to
 accessing this security scoped URL, and stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource
 needs to be called when done.

 Note that itemIdentifier should be set with no network call.  It doesn't have
 to be the final identifier.  If the identifier changes after talking to the
 server then the file provider should send a delete for the temporary, local
 identifier immediately followed by an add with the final identifier.

 This is expected to work offline even if there might be a collision (another
 item with the same filename and parentItemIdentifier) only detected when later
 syncing up this change to the server.  In that case, it is suggested that a
 follow up update to the item change its filename to something unique.  This
 wouldn't be considered an error to import.

 If however you can tell right away, with no communication to your server, that
 there is a collision then this call should fail with error code
 NSFileProviderErrorFilenameCollision generated with this method:
   -[NSError (NSFileProviderError) fileProviderErrorForCollisionWithItem:].

 The existing item set in this error will be used to handle the collision, and
 ask the user if she or he would like to replace the existing item.  This takes
 into account the existing item's capabilities (particularly
 NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsTrashing and AllowsDeleting.)

 Collision checks should be case insensitive even if the filesystem or file
 provider might allow two coexisting filenames differing only by their case.

 Upload errors (such as NSFileProviderErrorInsufficientQuota) should be handled
 with a subsequent update to the item, setting its uploadingError property.
 Upload errors should not prevent creating or importing a document, because they
 can be resolved at a later date (for example, when the user has quota again.)

 Other errors will be presented to the user, but are unexpected.  If you want to
 prevent imports in a given directory, then the directory item's capacities
 should exclude NSFileProviderItemCapabilitiesAllowsAddingSubItems.
