 *  @discussion Morphology functions modify the shape of dark and light elements in an image.  They can enlarge
 *              light structural elements (Dilate) or make them smaller by making the darker regions larger (Erode).
 *              The filters can be used in combination fill in holes (Dilate then Erode) or remove fine structure
 *              (Erode then Dilate).  The Erode and Dilate filters can themselves have structure. For example, you
 *              can Dilate in the shape of a star, in which case single pixel bright signal (such as stars in a night 
 *              sky) assume a star shape.  Larger structure elements assume something of a star-like shape, but generally will
 *              not become fully recognizable as such until the size of the filter exceeds the size of the image
 *              structure element. A small circular filter can turn a rectangle into a larger rectangle with round corners.
 *              Many other examples abound.
 *
 *              Min is a special case for an Erode function with a rectangular kernel that contains all the same value.
 *              Max is a special case for a Dilate function with a rectangular kernel that contains all the same value.
 *              Min and Max make use of a faster algorithm that can operate at much reduced cost.

 *  @functiongroup Dilate
 *  @discussion  A dilate filter uses a shaped probe to trace a 3D surface. Imagine the kernel to define a 2D surface with
 *               the third dimension the values in the kernel.  This is then lowered down over the image, itself treated
 *               as a 3D surface. The result image is the height at which the surface makes contact with the image for 
 *               each pixel in the image. In this respect it operates like a scanning electron microscope with an adjustable
 *               probe shape. In code:
 *               <pre> @textblock
 *                  for each pixel result[i][j] in the image{
 *                      int r = 0;
 *                      for( y = 0; y < kernel_height; y++ ){
 *                          for( x = 0; x < kernel_width; x++ ){
 *                              r = MAX( r, src[i+y-kernel_height/2][j+x-kernel_width/2] - k[y*kernel_width+x] )
 *                          }
 *                      }
 *
 *                      // normalize for kernel center not 0
 *                      r += k[y * (kernel_height/2) * kernel_width + kernel_width/2 ];
 *
 *                      // saturate overflow to representable range
 *                      result[i][j] = CLIP( r );
 *                  }
 *               @/textblock </pre>
 *               The ARGB variants apply the filter to the four channels in parallel. It should be noted that the application
 *               of the filter to the image causes the structure elements in the filter to be reflected into the image, reversed 
 *               top to bottom and left to right. Also, if the center of the kernel is not 0, a general lightening of the image
 *               will occur. Some functions will run much faster if the center of the kernel is 0.

 *               top to bottom and left to right. Also, if the center of the kernel is not 0, a general lightening of the image

 *  @discussion Convolution is a weighted average between a pixel and its neighboring pixels. By smoothing
 *              out high frequency signal, convolution can be used to blur an image. By subtracting out the
 *              low frequency signal, it can be used to produce a sharpening effect. Convolution is also used
 *              with a variety of filters such as Laplace and Sobel to detect edges in the image. Here we also 
 *              provide a deconvolution filter that attempts to iteratively undo the effect of a convolution. 
 *              Where the convolution kernel can be accurately determined, it can be used to remove focus 
 *              problems, motion blur and distortion introduced by the lens.

 *
 *              Since a weighted average of nearby pixels can for some positions extend off the edge of the
 *              input image, a variety of edging modes are provided which specify what happens in such
 *              cases:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually 
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0} 
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image. 
 *              
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels. 
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content. 
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel 
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *      @/textblock </pre>
 *              Only one edging mode may be active at a time.  Please see the Convolution section in

 *              When calling these interfaces from within the context of your own tiling engine,
 *              it may be necessary to produce a result tile starting from different points in the
 *              input image. Simply repackaging the input image by adjusting the height, width and
 *              src->data to achieve this affect will not work correctly because it introduces

 *  @functiongroup General Convolution
 *  @discussion A general convolve filter allows you to provide an arbitrary set of weights to use 
 *              in the weighted average between each pixel and its neighbors. As such, it is a 
 *              very flexible tool for achieving a variety of image effects, from blurring to sharpening
 *              to edge detection to sub-pixel image translation and motion blur.  
 *
 *              Some filters such as edge detection filters take the first derivative of the image 
 *              surface. Since a derivative can be either positive or negative  and some formats such
 *              as Planar8 (unorm8) can only represent positive numbers, the general convolution is also
 *              available in a form which allows you to provide a bias to add to the weighted sum before
 *              the divisor is applied, to shift the values into the positive.  You might provide a 
 *              bias of 128 * divisor to move the encoding for 0 to 128 so that negative numbers are
 *              representable, for example. (In this case, -20 would now be encoded as 128-20=108.)
 *
 *              Finally, vImage provides multikernel convolution, which allows a different kernel, bias
 *              and divisor to be used for each color channel. This might allow for the position of the
 *              different color channels to be shifted independently, or for alpha to be blurred differently
 *              from color.

 *              (Above, we imagine the kernel to be a 2D array of size kernel_height by kernel_width.

 *
 *  @param src              The input image
 *
 *  @param dest             A pointer to a preallocated vImage_Buffer to receive the result image.
 *                          This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters
 *                          you should use a temp buffer. If the function is called from different threads
 *                          concurrently, a different temp buffer should be used for each.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           A pointer to a 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:
 *                          <pre>@textblock
 *                          const int16_t kernel[9] = { 1, 2, 1,

 *                          @/textblock </pre>
 *
 *                          The kernel values may not sum in any combination to be outside the range
 *                          [-2**23, 2**23), or modulo overflow in the accumulator may result.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param divisor          The weighted sum of nearby pixels is typically a large number, which must be corrected
 *                          to fit back into the image format of the destination image. The correction factor 
 *                          is passed in as divisor here, and is divided from the sum before the result is 
 *                          returned. Typically, the divisor is the sum over the area of the kernel. If the divisor
 *                          is 0, 1 will be used instead.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the 
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does

 *
 *
 *  @param src              The input image
 *

 *                          This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters
 *                          you should use a temp buffer. If the function is called from different threads
 *                          concurrently, a different temp buffer should be used for each.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           A pointer to a 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:
 *                          <pre>@textblock
 *                          const int16_t kernel[9] = { 1, 2, 1,
 *                                                      2, 4, 2,
 *                                                      1, 2, 1 };

 *
 *                          The kernel values may not sum in any combination to be outside the range
 *                          [-2**23, 2**23), or modulo overflow in the accumulator may result.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param divisor          The weighted sum of nearby pixels is typically a large number, which must be corrected
 *                          to fit back into the image format of the destination image. The correction factor
 *                          is passed in as divisor here, and is divided from the sum before the result is
 *                          returned. Typically, the divisor is the sum over the area of the kernel. If the divisor
 *                          is 0, 1 will be used instead.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.

 *                          concurrently, a different temp buffer should be used for each.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           A pointer to a 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:
 *                          <pre>@textblock
 *                          const float kernel[9] =   { 1./16, 2./16, 1./16,
 *                                                      2./16, 4./16, 2./16,
 *                                                      1./16, 2./16, 1./16 };
 *                          @/textblock </pre>
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does
 *                                          not touch the src or dest image.
 *
 *              kvImageDoNotTile            Disable internal multithreading.

 *
 *          kvImageRoiLargerThanInputBuffer The dest->width and height must be less than or equal

 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated

 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.

 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.

 *                          [-2**23, 2**23), or modulo overflow in the accumulator may result.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param divisor          The weighted sum of nearby pixels is typically a large number, which must be corrected
 *                          to fit back into the image format of the destination image. The correction factor
 *                          is passed in as divisor here, and is divided from the sum before the result is
 *                          returned. Typically, the divisor is the sum over the area of the kernel. If the divisor
 *                          is 0, 1 will be used instead.
 *
 *  @param bias             This value is added to the sum of weighted pixels before the divisor is applied.
 *                          It can serve to both control rounding and adjust the brightness of the result.
 *                          A large bias (e.g 128 * divisor) may be required for some kernels to return

 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor

 *              (Above, we imagine the kernel to be a 2D array of size kernel_height by kernel_width.

 *
 *  @param src              The input image
 *
 *  @param dest             A pointer to a preallocated vImage_Buffer to receive the result image.
 *                          This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters
 *                          you should use a temp buffer. If the function is called from different threads
 *                          concurrently, a different temp buffer should be used for each.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           A pointer to a 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:
 *                          <pre>@textblock
 *                          const float kernel[9] =   { 1./16, 2./16, 1./16,

 *                                                      1./16, 2./16, 1./16 };
 *                          @/textblock </pre>
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param bias             This value is added to the sum of weighted pixels.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does
 *                                          not touch the src or dest image.

 *              kvImageDoNotTile            Disable internal multithreading.

 *  @param bias             This value is added to the sum of weighted pixels before the divisor is applied.
 *                          It can serve to both control rounding and adjust the brightness of the result.
 *                          A large bias (e.g 128 * divisor) may be required for some kernels, such as edge

 *
 *  @param src              The input image

 *                          This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated

 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           A pointer to a 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:

 *                          @/textblock </pre>
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param bias             This value is added to the sum of weighted pixels.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does
 *                                          not touch the src or dest image.

 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           An array of 4 pointers to weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          The kernel values in each array may not sum in any combination to be outside the range
 *                          [-2**23, 2**23), or modulo overflow in the accumulator may result.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param divisor          The weighted sum of nearby pixels is typically a large number, which must be corrected
 *                          to fit back into the image format of the destination image. The correction factor
 *                          is passed in as divisor here, and is divided from the sum before the result is
 *                          returned. Typically, the divisor is the sum over the area of the kernel. If the divisor
 *                          is 0, 1 will be used instead.
 *
 *  @param bias             This array of values is added to the sum of weighted pixels for each channel respectively
 *                          before the divisor is applied. It can serve to both control rounding and adjust the 
 *                          brightness of the result. A large bias (e.g 128 * divisor) may be required for some 
 *                          kernels, such as edge detection filters, to return representable results.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does
 *                                          not touch the src or dest image.

 *  @param src              The input image
 *
 *  @param dest             A pointer to a preallocated vImage_Buffer to receive the result image.
 *                          This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during

 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size

 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters
 *                          you should use a temp buffer. If the function is called from different threads

 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.

 * @functiongroup Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution
 *
 * @discussion Richardson-Lucy deconvolution (a.k.a. Lucy-Richardson) is an iterative procedure for estimating what an original image
 *  probably was before a convolution, given the convolution end result and the kernel used to create it.  It is typically used to fix blurring caused
 *  by lens distortion, most famously for the Hubble telescope, but also to improve images in confocal microscopy and other uses. When used
 *  to correct loss of signal due to physical limitations of the imaging system, the point spread function (kernel) is estimated from known
 *  parameters associated with the lensing system. It can also be used to sharpen images that have been digitally blurred, as long as the 
 *  original convolution kernel is known or can be estimated.
 *
 *  This routine iteratively uses the following formula:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *		e[i+1] = e[i] x (psf0 * ( e[0] / (psf1 * e[i]) ) )
 *
 *		where:
 *              e[0] = the observed image (src parameter)
 *              e[n] = the result of the nth iteration
 *              psf  = point spread function (kernel for call to convolution)
 *				x    = multiply operator
 *              '*'  = convolution operator
 *      @/textblock </pre>
 *  As with any sharpening operation, Richardson-Lucy amplifies noise, and at some number of iterations the noise becomes noticeable as artifacts.

 *  The work in these functions is currently done internally with floating point precision. If you plan to call this function multiple times
 *  (rather than with iterationCount > 1) on 8-bit per channel images, you can save some computation by converting the 8-bit image data to
 *  single precision floating-point yourself using something like vImageConvert_Planar8toPlanarF and iterating on the appropriate
 *  floating-point Richardson Lucy variant. Convert back, when you are done.

 * @param src           The input image
 *
 * @param dest          A preallocated buffer to receive the result image. 
 *                      This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters
 *                          you should use a temp buffer. If the function is called from different threads
 *                          concurrently, a different temp buffer should be used for each.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel           A pointer to a 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height x kernel_width.
 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:

 *
 *                          This is psf0 in the formula given in the discussion.
 *
 *  @param kernel2          A pointer to a second 1D array of weights of dimension kernel_height2 x kernel_width2.
 *                          This is psf1 in the formula given in the discussion.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel1. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel1. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height2   The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel2. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width2    The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel2. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param divisor          The divisor to use to correct for the volume under kernel.
 *
 *  @param divisor2         The divisor to use to correct for the volume under kernel2.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *  
 *  @param iterationCount   The number of Richardson-Lucy iterations to perform on the data before returning. 
 *                          If 0, the src buffer is coped to dest.
 *
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does
 *                                          not touch the src or dest image.
 *
 *              kvImageDoNotTile            Disable internal multithreading.

 * @function vImageRichardsonLucyDeConvolve_ARGB8888
 * @abstract Perform N iterations of a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution on ARGB8888 data.
 * @discussion
 *  This routine iteratively uses the following formula:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *		e[i+1] = e[i] x (psf0 * ( e[0] / (psf1 * e[i]) ) )
 *
 *		where:
 *              e[0] = the observed image (src parameter)
 *              e[n] = the result of the nth iteration
 *              psf  = point spread function (kernel for call to convolution)
 *				x    = multiply operator
 *              '*'  = convolution operator
 *      @/textblock </pre>
 *  The channels are operated on independently of one another. Consequently, this function will work on
 *  any 4-channel interleaved 8-bit per component format (e.g. RGBA, BGRA...), not just ARGB. 
 *
 *  The work in these functions is currently done internally with floating point precision. If you plan to call this function multiple times
 *  (rather than with iterationCount > 1) on 8-bit per channel images, you can save some computation by converting the 8-bit image data to
 *  single precision floating-point yourself using something like vImageConvert_Planar8toPlanarF and iterating on the appropriate
 *  floating-point Richardson Lucy variant. Convert back, when you are done.
 *
 *  Does not work in place.
 *
 * @param src           The input image
 *
 * @param dest          A preallocated buffer to receive the result image.
 *                      This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function
 *                          with the same parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag, in which case
 *                          the size is returned instead of an error code from the left hand side.
 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters

 *                          concurrently, a different temp buffer should be used for each.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.

 *                          For example, for a simple 3x3 blur, it might be:

 *                          This is psf0 in the formula given in the discussion.

 *                          This is psf1 in the formula given in the discussion.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel1. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel1. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height2   The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel2. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width2    The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel2. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param divisor          The divisor to use to correct for the volume under kernel.
 *
 *  @param divisor2         The divisor to use to correct for the volume under kernel2.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.

 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *

 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other

 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar

 *  @functiongroup Box Convolve
 *  @discussion  A box convolve is a special case of the standard convolution, which has a much faster algorithm.
 *               A box kernel is a kernel populated with all 1's. This returns the unweighted average of the pixels
 *               near the result pixel. Unlike general purpose convolution, the cost of a box convolve algorithm
 *               is theoretically constant regardless of kernel size, so it can be an inexpensive choice for very
 *               large blurs. The box convolve behavior may not be as desired, however, because the blur effect is
 *               rectangular in appearance, whereas most expect it to be gaussian or roughly circular. A tent blur has 
 *               similar rectangular character, but because the weighting is non uniform, it is less obvious. A
 *               tent blur is also constant cost per pixel, but larger constant cost.
 *
 *               Two box blur passes of the same kernel size results in a tent blur.  To see this we can take a 1-d starting image:
 *                <pre> @textblock
 *                      p0          p1          p2          p3          p4          p5          p6
 *                @/textblock </pre>
 *               and blur it once with a 3 wide box blur, ignoring for the moment what happens at the edges:
 *                <pre> @textblock
 *                     (edge)    p0+p1+p2    p1+p2+p3    p2+p3+p4    p3+p4+p5    p4+p5+p6    p5+p6+p7

 *               and a second time:
 *                <pre> @textblock
 *                     (edge)           p0+2p1+3p2+2p3+p4       p2+2p3+3p4+2p5+p6       p4+2p5+3p6+2p7+p8 .....

 *                @/textblock </pre>
 *
 *                If this process is continued, the shape converges towards a gaussian over multiple passes.

 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image

 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does

 *  @functiongroup Tent Convolve
 *  @discussion  A tent convolve is a special case of the standard convolution, which has a much faster algorithm.
 *               A tent kernel is a kernel populated with slope of 1 rising towards the center. 2D kernels
 *               are calculated as the product of the appropriate 1D kernels. e.g.
 *               <pre> @textblock
 *                  {1,2,3,2,1}
 *               @/textblock </pre>
 *               or 
 *               <pre> @textblock
 *               |1|                { {1,2,1},
 *               |2| *  {1,2,1} =     {2,4,2},
 *               |1|                  {1,2,1}   }
 *               @/textblock </pre>
 *               This returns a blur that is more heavily weighted towards the center pixel than a box blur.
 *
 *               Unlike general purpose convolution, the cost of a tent convolve algorithm is theoretically constant 
 *               regardless of kernel size, so it can be an inexpensive choice for very large blurs. The tent convolve 
 *               behavior may not be as desired, however, because the blur effect is rectangular in appearance, whereas 
 *               most expect a blurring effect to be gaussian or roughly circular. The rectangularity of the tent blur
 *               is less obvious than the box blur.  A tent blur has somewhat larger constant cost than a box blur.

 *              The image should be non-premultiplied to avoid odd results in non-opaque regions.
 *
 *  @param src              The input image
 *
 *  @param dest             A pointer to a preallocated vImage_Buffer to receive the result image.
 *                          This may not alias the src image.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer       An optional pointer to a region of memory to use as a working area during
 *                          computation.  The size of the tempBuffer is given by calling the function

 *                          You may pass NULL here, in which case a region of memory of similar size
 *                          will be allocated by the function and freed before it returns.  Temp Buffers
 *                          are a way of avoiding lost time due to VM faults to initialize newly allocated
 *                          buffers. If you will be calling this function repeatedly with similar parameters
 *                          you should use a temp buffer. If the function is called from different threads

 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_X An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image

 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the left edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param srcOffsetToROI_Y An offset used in tiling to shift the position of the destination image
 *                          relative to the src image. Typically this is 0. Non-Zero values are needed
 *                          when the destination tile is not aligned with the top edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param kernel_height    The height of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param kernel_width     The width of the 2D table of weights passed in as kernel. It must be an odd number.
 *
 *  @param backgroundColor  When the kvImageBackgroundColorFill edging mode is active, the backgroundColor
 *                          parameter provides the background color to be used for missing pixels when the
 *                          kernel extends off the edge of the image.
 *
 *  @param flags            The following flags are allowed:
 *      <pre>@textblock
 *              kvImageCopyInPlace          If any pixels covered by the kernel do no not exist, simply
 *                                          copy the corresponding source pixel to the destination. This
 *                                          will result in a ring on unconvolved content at the edges
 *                                          and convolved content in the middle.
 *
 *              kvImageBackgroundColorFill  Substitute in the provided background color for missing pixels.
 *                                          For a blur filter this will look like the edges of the image
 *                                          have been blurred into a particular color. This is usually
 *                                          appropriate when the color of the surface onto which the image
 *                                          will be drawn is known.  You can also use {Alpha = 0, color = 0}
 *                                          as a background color, and let the downstream image compositor
 *                                          blend in the background color. In this case, the result image
 *                                          should be treated as a premultiplied image.
 *
 *              kvImageEdgeExtend           Substitute in the nearest defined pixel for missing pixels.
 *                                          This is better when the image is drawn into a frame or other
 *                                          context where the background is not expected to contribute to
 *                                          the final content.
 *
 *              kvImageTruncateKernel       This is similar to kvImageEdgeExtend, except that edge pixels are
 *                                          simply ignored, and the bias and divisor are adjusted accordingly.
 *                                          Because of the complication at the edges, this edging mode can
 *                                          be significantly slower than the others. It can be numerically
 *                                          unstable if the sum over any rectangular subsection of the kernel
 *                                          is zero, which can result in division by zero during the computation.
 *                                          The results for this edging mode are usually quite visually similar
 *                                          to kvImageEdgeExtend.
 *
 *              kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Instead of calculating the convolution of the image, return the
 *                                          size of the temp buffer needed for this set of parameters. Does
 *                                          not touch the src or dest image.

 *  @discussion
 *  Alpha compositing is the practice of blending one image into another using a coverage component, commonly called
 *  alpha, to indicate how opaque each pixel is.  A value of 1.0 (or 255 if an 8-bit image) indicates the
 *  pixel is fully opaque. A value of 0 indicates that it is fully transparent. Values in beetween establish a linear scale
 *  of partial opacity. Alpha can be used to slowly fade one image into another. Some images such as icons, have opqaue
 *  portions and transparent portions. A blending operation based on alpha is required to draw these over a background 
 *  image.
 *
 *  In its simplest form, an alpha blend is a linear interpolation between pixel of two images:
 * <pre>@textblock
 *      float: new color =  top color * alpha + (1-alpha) * bottom color
 *      8-bit: new color =  (top color * alpha + (255-alpha) * bottom color + 127) / 255
 * @/textblock </pre>
 *  However, these formulations are a bit too simplistic because they do not account for the possibility that
 *  the bottom layer may have some transparency to it too. One subtlety of adding transparency to the bottom image
 *  is that the result image has an alpha component to it too that should be divided out:
 * <pre>@textblock
 *      float: new alpha =  top alpha + (1-top alpha) * bottom alpha
 *      float: new color =  (top color * top alpha + (1- top alpha) * bottom color * bottom alpha ) / new alpha
 *
 *      8-bit: new alpha =  top alpha + ((255-top alpha) * bottom alpha + 127)/255
 *      8-bit: new color =  (255 * top color * top alpha + (255- top alpha) * bottom color * bottom alpha + (255*255)/2) / (255 * 255 * new alpha)
 * @/textblock </pre>
 * As might be imagined, this extra complication may become costly.  At the cost of a small amount of accuracy in non-opaque regions
 * of the image, it is common to leave the alpha multiplied into the image. This avoids the division at the end. In addition,
 * if the result is used in another blend, we don't have to multiply the alpha back in at that stage, which simplifies things
 * all around. Such images with the alpha channel multiplied into the other channels are called pre-multiplied images.
 *
 * This gives us the following for premultiplied alpha blends:
 * <pre>@textblock
 *      float: new alpha               = top alpha +               (1 - top alpha) * bottom alpha
 *      float: new premultiplied color = top premultiplied color + (1 - top alpha) * bottom premultiplied color
 *
 *      8-bit: new alpha               =  top alpha +               ((255 - top alpha) * bottom alpha + 127)/255
 *      8-bit: new premultiplied color =  top premultiplied color + ((255 - top alpha) * bottom premultiplied color + 127)/255
 * @/textblock </pre>
 *
 * Some images are known to be fully opaque. For such images, alpha is 1.0 (or 255) for all the pixels, and consequently
 * do not require any computation to be done to interconvert between premultiplied and non-premultiplied states. That is,
 * since x/1 = x  and x*1 = x, they are non-premultiplied and premultiplied at the same time, and can serve in either 
 * capacity as needed.  Because of this special status, CoreGraphics labels them kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst/Last. vImage
 * does similar things in vImage_Utilities.h. Labelling opaque buffers as such enables cheaper alpha blending and will frequently
 * will let us avoid blending all-together as a simple copy operation will do.
 *
 * This header provides compositing (blending) operations for both premultiplied and non-premultiplied images, functions 
 * to premultiply or unpremultiply images, and some functions to make sure that the color channel values do not exceed
 * the alpha value, which sometimes can happen after a convolution, morphological or resampling operation.
 *
 *	These alpha compositing functions assume that the floating point range is 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (full intensity color).
 *	While values outside these ranges do function correctly (you can have 110% intensity color or -50% color, for example),
 *	the calculation is done assuming 1.0 represents full intensity color, and 0.0 represents the absence of color. If these
 *	assumptions are not correct, then the calculation will produce incorrect results. Apple does not currently provide
 *	alpha compositing functions that work with any floating point range in vImage.
 *
 *	8 bit functionality assumes that 0 is no color, and 255 is full color. 8 bit functions do saturated clipping before
 *	converting from internal precision back to 8 bits to make sure that modulo overflow does not occur. The internal 
 *  calculation is done with higher precision.

 *  @header Conversion.h
 *  vImage_Framework
 *
 *  See vImage/vImage.h for more on how to view the headerdoc documentation for functions declared herein.
 *
 *  @discussion  This header lists conversions between the many different image formats supported by vImage.  The core formats:
 *      <pre> @textblock
 *          Planar 8        Planar 16U      Planar 16S      Float
 *          ARGB8888        ARGB16U         ARGB16S         ARGBFFFF        (also available in other channel orderings)
 *      @/textblock </pre>
 *  are supported generally throughout vImage. Other formats may need to be converted to a core format before much can be
 *  done with them. Many conversions between core formats as well as those between core formats and non-core formats are available here.
 *  Please also see vImage_Utilities.h and vImage_CVUtilities.h for interfaces that allow for conversion between various CoreGraphics
 *  and CoreVideo formats.  In many cases, those interfaces can serve as a simpler entrypoint into these APIs. They should be strongly 
 *  considered in cases where your code has to handle a variety of different image formats. These interfaces provide direct access to 
 *  the low-level workhorse functions for the case when you know exactly what image formats you are working with and want to just call
 *  the right conversion directly.
 *
 *  Generally speaking, conversions are much faster than other image filters. When tiled correctly, they do not add a lot of extra cost
 *  in cases where you find that your image format is not directly supported by other image filters. They are usually fast enough that 
 *  their performance is bottlenecked by throughput to L2, L3, etc. caches.  They benefit greatly from tiling, usually performing best 
 *  with wide tile sizes that are less than half the size of the L1 cache. Because of the L1 cache residency requirement for best performance,
 *  they are often not internally multithreaded (it wouldn't help for out-of-cache performance and would cause slowdowns for in-cache) 
 *  and may need  to be used within the context of your tiling engine (or vImageConvert_AnyToAny) to reach peak performance. If you are calling
 *  vImage functions within your own multithreaded tiling engine, it is recommended that you use the kvImageDoNotTile flag to make sure that
 *  vImage does its work on the calling thread. This will help ensure that the data just produced on that thread by a previous pass 
 *  is resident in the correct L1 cache for the next pass.

 *
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered - pre-computed blue noise is added to the image before rounding to the values in
 *                      the destination format.  The offset into this blue noise is randomized per-call to avoid visible artifacts
 *                      if you do your own tiling or call the function on sequential frames of video.
 *
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherOrderedReproducible - pre-computed blue noise is added to the image before rounding to the
 *                      values in the destination format.  The offset into the blue noise is the same for every call to allow users
 *                      to get reproducible results. Fine for still images. For video kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered is a better choice.
 *          @/textblock
 *          </pre>
 *                  The ordered dither methods may be further influenced by shaping the distribution of the noise using the gaussian and uniform options below.
 *                  These options are OR-ed with kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered / kvImageConvert_DitherOrderedReproducible:
 *          <pre>
 *          @textblock
 *                  kvImageConvert_OrderedGaussianBlue - when using an ordered dither pattern, distribute the noise according to a gaussian
 *                      distribution. This generally gives more pleasing images --  less noisy and perhaps a little more saturated -- but color
 *                      fidelity can suffer. Its effect is between kvImageConvert_DitherNone and kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered | kvImageConvert_DitherUniform.
 *                      This is the default for kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered and kvImageConvert_DitherOrderedReproducible.
 *
 *                  kvImageConvert_OrderedUniformBlue - when using an ordered dither pattern, distribute the noise uniformly. This generally gives
 *                      best color fidelity, but the resulting image is noisier and more obviously dithered. This is usually the best choice when low
 *                      bitdepth content is drawn next to high bitdepth content and in other circumstances where subtle changes to color arising from the conversion
 *                      could be easily noticed. It may be a poor choice when the image is likely to be enlarged -- this would cause the noise to become
 *                      more evident-- and for very flat / synthetic content with little inherent noise. The enlargement problem may be avoided by enlarging
 *                      first at high bitdepth, then convert to lower bitdepth.
 *          @/textblock
 *          </pre>
 *
 *                  To clarify: "Blue" noise does not look blue, nor does it operate solely on the blue color channel. Blue noise is monochrome noise that is added to all color
 *                  channels equally. The name arises from blue light, which has a higher frequency than other colors of visible light. Thus, blue noise is noise which is
 *                  weighted heavily towards high frequencies. Low frequency noise tends to have visible shapes in it that would become apparent in an image if it was added in,
 *                  so it is excluded from the dither pattern.

 *      The scale and offset here are designed to be the same offset and scale used for the vImageConvert_16UToF conversion.
 *      For a lossless round trip (within the limits of floating point precision), use the same scale and offset values

 *
 *              vImageConvert_16UToF( uint16_buffer, float_buffer, myOffset, myScale, kvImageNoFlags );   //Convert to float
 *              vImageConvert_FTo16U( float_buffer, uint16_buffer, myOffset, myScale, kvImageNoFlags );   //Convert back to uint16_t
 *
 *  works in place, as long as src->data == dest->data and src->rowBytes == dest->rowBytes.
 *  To convert multichannel interleaved floating point formats (e.g. ARGB_FFFF) to a multichannel 16-bit image format with the same channel ordering, 
 *  simply multiply the vImage_Buffer.width by the number of channels.

/*
 *  vImageConvert_Planar8ToARGBFFFF
 *
 *  Conversion routines to convert planar 8-bit buffers to packed (interleaved) 4 channel floating point format.
 *
 *  The meaning of maxFloat and minFloat here is substatially the same as for vImageConvert_Planar8toPlanarF. The difference is that since this is a four channel
 *  image, we use four channel min and max values so that different mins and maxes can be used for each channel. The channels in minFloat and maxFloat are in the 
 *  same order as the output pixels. MaxFloat is allowed to be less than MinFloat, in which case the image will come out looking like a photographic negative.
 *  (That is, you get a free contrast + brightness adjustment as part of this conversion.)
 *
 *  The vImageConvert_Planar8ToARGBFFFF function is the workhorse of this family. The other three are provided as a convenience. You can actually substitute
 *  any of the channels with a constant by replacing the vImage_Buffer passed in for that channel with one from another color channel, and set 
 *  maxFloat.color = minFloat.color = desired color for that channel. (In the particular case where you want all four channels to be constant, please call 
 *  vImageBufferFill_ARGBFFFF instead.) Likewise, though these API names appear to correspond to particular color channel orders, vImage has no way of knowing what 
 *  is actually red or green or cyan, so you can use them for other color spaces and other packing orders. Thus, vImageConvert_Planar8ToARGBFFFF should be 
 *  properly considered a somewhat color space agnostic <=4 planar 8-bit channel to 4 channel packed float conversion function. 
 *
 *  Performance data on Intel Core2 and G5 suggest that like most simple conversion functions, these functions only perform well if the data is already in the cache. 
 *  Optimum tile sizes are between ~200 pixels and somewhere in the 50000 to 200000 pixel range, depending on cache size. If the image is larger than that, this 
 *  function is limited by the throughput of the machine's front side bus and will run anywhere from 3 to 10 times slower. For well sized images / times, we observe 
 *  that the vector code is 3-12x faster than scalar code. For images that don't fit in cache or that are not in cache, the vector code is perhaps only 10% faster 
 *  than scalar.
 *
 *  Flags: 
 *      kvImageGetTempBufferSize    returns 0. Does no work.
 *      kvImageDoNotTile            Disables internal multithreading, if any.
 *
 *      Other flags cause the function to return kvImageUnknownFlagsBit.
 *
 *  These routines do not work in place.

/*
 *  vImageConvert_PlanarFToARGB8888
 *
 *  Conversion routines to convert planar float buffers to packed (interleaved) 4 channel 8-bit unsigned format.
 *
 *  The meaning of maxFloat and minFloat here is similar to vImageConvert_PlanarFtoPlanar8. That is, the max and min define the pixel values for
 *  100% and 0% light saturation respectively. (Pixel values outside that range are clamped into that range before we do arithmetic.) Since this function works on
 *  multichannel data, we pass in multichannel maxes and mins. The channel order in maxFloat and minFloat is the same as for the desired result pixel. The calculation
 *  is as follows for each channel:
 *
 *      uint8_t result = ROUND_TO_INTEGER( SATURATED_CLAMP_0_to_255( 255.0f * ( srcPixel[channel] - minFloat[channel] ) / (maxFloat[channel] - minFloat[channel]) ));
 *
 *  The ROUND_TO_INTEGER function here behaves identically to the C99 lrintf() function. It rounds to integer using the prevailing floating point rounding mode.
 *  By default, that is round to nearest integer (ties go to the even result).  You can change the rounding mode using interfaces in fenv.h, specfically fesetround() 
 *  and fegetround(), if you prefer that the calculation round up, or down.
 *
 *  It is allowed that maxFloat[channel] < minFloat[channel], in which case you'll get an image that appears a bit like a photgraphic negative. The astute reader will
 *  note that these routines provide a free per-channel brightness and contrast adjustment.
 *
 *  In the special case that maxFloat[channel] == minFloat[channel], then the calculation is instead as follows:
 *
 *      uint8_t result = ROUND_TO_INTEGER( SATURATED_CLIP_0_to_255( 255.0f * maxFloat[channel] ) );
 *
 *  This serves two purposes. It guarantees we can't get a division by zero. It also provides a way to set certain channels to a constant, rather than use
 *  a source buffer. You'll still need to pass in a source buffer for that channel, the data also needs to be valid, but it wont actually affect the result. It should
 *  be sufficient to substitute one of the other source buffers in for the color channel that you wish to be constant. If you intend to produce a buffer full of a 
 *  solid color, please use vImageBufferFill_ARGB8888 instead. Two special purpose routines are provided for constant alpha in either the first or last position 
 *  in the pixel, vImageConvert_PlanarFToXRGB8888, vImageConvert_PlanarFToBGRX8888. On some platforms, these may be a little bit faster.   
 *
 *  Numerics note: We don't actually do the full caculation described above. The constant terms are precalculated. We are really doing the following:
 *
 *      float a = 255.0f / (maxFloat[channel] - minFloat[channel]);
 *      float b = minFloat[channel] * -a;
 *
 *      uint8_t result = ROUND_TO_INTEGER( SATURATED_CLAMP( srcPixel[channel], minFloat[channel], maxFloat[channel]) * a  + b ));
 *
 *  This may cause slightly different rounding when scaling the pixel to the 0..255 range. In very rare cases, that may produce a result pixel that differs from the 
 *  true calculation by 1. NaNs produce 0.  
 *
 *  Flags: 
 *      kvImageGetTempBufferSize    returns 0. Does no work.
 *      kvImageDoNotTile            Disables internal multithreading, if any.
 *
 *      Other flags cause the function to return kvImageUnknownFlagsBit.
 *
 *  These can work in place provided that for each buffer "buf" that overlaps with dest:
 *          buf->data must be equal to dest->data and buf->rowBytes >= dest->rowBytes
 *          If buf has a different rowBytes from dest, kvImageDoNotTile must be also passed in the flags

 *                  source pixel format is smaller than a byte, there are
 *                  multiple pixels in each byte of the data buffer.  These

 *                  byte).
 *
 *                  Sub-byte indexing of scanlines is unsupported, because the

 *                  whole bytes.
 *
 *                  Widths, however, are measured in pixels, so a scanline may
 *                  end in the middle of a byte.  If this occurs, the contents
 *                  of any unused bits of the final byte are ignored.
 *
 *      dest        Pointer to the destination vImage_Buffer object.
 *
 *      flags       The following flags are allowed:
 *
 *                  kvImageDoNotTile - disables internal threading.  You may
 *                      want to specify this if you have your own threading
 *                      scheme and need to avoid interference.
 *
 *                  kvImageGetTempBufferSize - does no work and returns zero,
 *                      as these functions do not use temp buffers.
 *
 *  Operation:
 *  ----------
 *      For each pixel in the destination image, the resulting value is the
 *      corresponding pixel value from the source image multiplied by 255, 85,
 *      or 17 (for Planar1, Planar2, or Planar4, respectively).
 *
 *
 *  Return values:
 *  --------------

 *                                  set in the flags parameter.
 *      kvImageBufferSizeMismatch   No work was done because the source
 *                                  image isn't large enough to cover the

 *
 *      dest        Pointer to the destination vImage_Buffer object.  Because

 *
 *      tempBuffer  Pointer to temporary buffer for the routine to use for

 *
 *      dither      Type of dithering to apply to the image, if any.  Options:
 *
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherNone - apply no dithering; input values
 *                      are rounded to the nearest value representable in the
 *                      destination format.
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered - pre-computed blue noise is
 *                      added to the image before rounding to the values in
 *                      the destination format.  The offset into this blue
 *                      noise is randomized per-call to avoid visible artifacts
 *                      if you do your own tiling or call the function on
 *                      sequential frames of video.
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherOrderedReproducible - pre-computed
 *                      blue noise is added to the image before rounding to the
 *                      values in the destination format.  The offset into the
 *                      blue noise is the same for every call to allow users
 *                      to get reproducible results.
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherFloydSteinberg - Floyd-Steinberg
 *                      dithering is applied to the image.
 *                  kvImageConvert_DitherAtkinson - Atkinson dithering is
 *                      applied to the image, for the old timers.
 *
 *                  The ordered dither methods may be further influenced by shaping the
 *                  distribution of the noise using the gaussian and uniform options below. 
 *                  These options are OR-ed with kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered / kvImageCon-
 *                  vert_DitherOrderedReproducible:
 *
 *                  kvImageConvert_OrderedGaussianBlue - when using an ordered dither
 *                      pattern, distribute the noise according to a gaussian
 *                      distribution. This generally gives more pleasing images --
 *                      less noisy and perhaps a little more saturated -- but color 
 *                      fidelity can suffer. Its effect is between kvImageConvert_DitherNone
 *                      and kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered | kvImageConvert_DitherUniform.
 *                      This is the default for kvImageConvert_DitherOrdered and 
 *                      kvImageConvert_DitherOrderedReproducible.
 *
 *                  kvImageConvert_OrderedUniformBlue - when using an ordered dither
 *                      pattern, distribute the noise uniformly. This generally gives 
 *                      best color fidelity, but the resulting image is noisier and more
 *                      obviously dithered. This is usually the best choice when low 
 *                      bitdepth content is drawn next to high bitdepth content and in other
 *                      circumstances where subtle changes to color arising from the conversion 
 *                      could be easily noticed. It may be a poor choice when the image 
 *                      is likely to be enlarged -- this would cause the noise to become 
 *                      more evident-- and for very flat / synthetic content with little 
 *                      inherent noise. The enlargement problem may be avoided by enlarging 
 *                      first at high bitdepth, then convert to lower bitdepth. 
 *
 *                  To clarify: "Blue" noise is not blue, nor does it operate solely on the blue 
 *                  color channel. Blue noise is monochrome noise that is added to all color 
 *                  channels equally. The name arises from blue light, which has a higher frequency 
 *                  than other colors of visible light. Thus, blue noise is noise which is
 *                  weighted heavily towards high frequencies. Low frequency noise tends to have 
 *                  visible shapes in it that would become apparent in an image if it was added in,
 *                  so it is excluded from the dither pattern.
 *
 *      flags       The following flags are allowed:
 *
 *                  kvImageDoNotTile - disables internal threading.  You may
 *                      want to specify this if you have your own threading
 *                      scheme and need to avoid interference.
 *
 *                  kvImageGetTempBufferSize - does no work, but returns the
 *                      required size of tempBuffer for this routine.
 *
 *  Operation:
 *  ----------
 *      For a brief description of each dither method, see dither above.
 *
 *      Notes:
 *      The results for Floyd-Steinberg and Atkinson dithering methods depend on the results 
 *      of pixels around each result pixel. Consequently, these methods do not tile well. (Tiling  
 *      can cause visible artifacts at tile boundaries because residuals are not propagated to the 
 *      next tile in a manner consistent with how it is propagated within a tile.) You should pass
 *      the entire image in a single call for good results with Atkinson and Floyd-Steinberg.
 *
 *      The ordered dithering method is suitable for tiled / multithreaded / scanline-at-a-time 
 *      execution. In addition to being spatially random, the ordered dithering pattern is also
 *      temporally random. This is necessary to prevent stripes when it is invoked scanline-at-a-time.
 *      Temporal randomness also prevents visible walking of the dither pattern across the image 
 *      when used for video. Because it is temporally random, results from this filter are not 
 *      reproducible.
 *
 *      To get reproducible results with ordered dithering, use the OrderedReproducible
 *      dithering attribute.
 *      
 *      The dither none option will produce reproducible results in all calling contexts, but 
 *      is prone to obvious banding in images, especially in regions of an image with a smooth 
 *      gradient.
 *
 *  Return values:
 *  --------------
 *      kvImageNoError              Success
 *      kvImageUnknownFlagsBit      No work was done because an unknown bit was
 *                                  set in the flags parameter.
 *      kvImageBufferSizeMismatch   No work was done because the source
 *                                  image isn't large enough to cover the
 *                                  destination image.
 *      kvImageInvalidParameter     An unrecognized or unsupported value was
 *                                  specified for dither.
 *
 *  These functions do not work in place.

     YpCbCr image formats:
     =====================
     Some details about video formats are provided below to provide some context for interpreting parameters passed to YpCbCr conversion functions.
     
     Luminance and Chrominance
     -------------------------
     Luminance is the brightness in an image. An example might be the image visible on a black and white television. Luminance (Y, Y or Yp)
     is defined as a weighted sum of the color components, usually weighted according to the relative ability of red, green and blue to cause
     perceived brightness changes in an image. For example for ITU-Recommendation BT.709 images, the Y component is given as:
     
     Y = 0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B
     
     Chrominance (Cb and Cr) is the correction applied to the luminance to add color information. For ITU-R BT.709 they would be:
     
     Cb  = 0.5389*(B-Y)
     Cr  = 0.6350*(R-Y)
     
     Together, these can be written as an invertible 3x3 color matrix that converts {R,G,B} to {Yp, Cb, Cr}.
     
     Since chrominance is calculated as the difference between two unsigned values, it itself is signed. Typically, a large bias is added to
     the chrominance value when it is encoded as an unsigned integer to make negative values representable. For example, 8-bit chrominance
     values typically have an implicit +128 in them. To convert a full range 8-bit chroma value to an unbiased floating point representation,
     it would be:
     
     Pb = (Cb - 128) / 127
     
     and so a full range chrominance value actually varies in the range [1,255] indicating [-1.0, 1.0]. See also Video Range.
     
     YpCbCr video color representations are typically specified in terms of a RGB colorspace and a typically 3x3 matrix to convert RGB to YpCbCr.
     The RGB colorspace itself is also defined relative to an absolute XYZ colorspace.  This is typically done using some x,y,z (little xyz!)
     primaries defining the size of the color cube and a transfer function that describes the conversion from linear color to non-linear RGB. The
     transfer function is usually of a form that can be evaluated with vImagePiecewiseGamma_<fmt> (see vImage/Transform.h). It should be noted that
     both of these are customarily defined in the opposite direction from an ICC profile. Whereas an ICC profile is conversion from display colorspace
     to linear XYZ, video formats are from XYZ to YpCbCr. Thus, the matrices and the gamma are inverted.
     
     Chroma subsampling
     ------------------
     Since the human eye is better at getting positional information from luminance changes than chrominance changes, the chrominance signal is
     often subsampled relative to luminance. (For each chrominance sample, there may be 2 or 4 luminance ones.) This saves memory. See
     [sampling ratio] below.
     
     Chroma Siting
     -------------
     Chroma subsampling also brings with it the possibility of differences in how the chroma samples are positioned relative to the luminance samples.
     For example for 422, they may overlap the left one, or the right one, or be positioned between them. This is called chroma siting. Many video
     formats are available for a diversity of siting options. However, for OS X.10 and iOS 8, vImage does only the centered variant
     (kCVImageBufferChromaLocation_Center). Please file a bug report to request other siting modes where they are found to be necessary.
     
     Video Range
     -----------
     Video formats commonly do not use the entire representable range available to them to encode video data. A 8-bit video range signal may use
     the range [16,235] instead of [0,255] to represent the range of signal strengths [0,1.0] for luminance, and [16,240] for chroma. A video signal
     that uses the full [0,255] ([1,255] for chroma) is said to be full range.
     
     Pixel Blocks
     -------------
     Since some channels are sampled at a higher rate than other channels, it is common to group multiple pixels together in a block which is
     encoded or decoded as a unit. Blocks are useful because they are an integer multiple of a byte in size and describe a particular
     repeating component order that can be serviced in a loop. See [sampling ratio] below for common ways in which multiple YpCbCr pixels fit
     together in a block. An example might be a 2vuy image (422CbYpCrYp8 to vImage) which has luminance and chrominance for two pixels packed
     together in a block as {Cb, Yp, Cr, Yp}.  The chrominance is shared between the two pixels, but each has its own luminance.
 
     In all cases, the beginning of a scanline must also be the beginning of a block, and must be at least byte aligned.  We do not support cases where
     a block spans multiple block rows. If the width of an image is not a multiple of the block width (or height is not a multiple of a block height)
     and you are writing to a YpCbCr format, then the edge pixels are in effect duplicated (see kvImageEdgeExtend) until the image is a multiple of
     the block size and the larger image is encoded to YpCbCr. If you are converting from a subsampled YpCbCr image to a non-subsampled format, then
     we only write out the pixels that fit in the vImage_Buffer.height and vImage_Buffer.width provided. You should be careful to keep the original
     height and width, since edges of the wider images may look like image artifacts if they appear onscreen.
 
     Nomenclature used in vImage
     ---------------------------
     To cover the many different packing orders, chroma subsamplings and separate image planes, we adopt the following naming convention here 
     as an extension of that commonly used here for RGB images:
     
     [sampling ratio][order of appearance of components in block][bitdepth](_[sampling ratio][order of appearance of components in block] for plane 2)...
     
     Examples:
     
     444YpCbCrA8		Each chunk is one pixel. Channels are 8-bit interleaved in the order A, Yp, Cb, Cr.  kCVPixelFormatType_4444YpCbCrA8
     422CbYpCrYp8		Each chunk is two horizontally adjacent pixels. Channels are 8-bit interleaved in the order Cb, Yp0, Cr, Yp0. (2vuy)
     422CbYpCrYp8_AA8   Like 422CbYpCrYp8 but with a separate alpha channel added. (kCVPixelFormatType_422YpCbCr_4A_8BiPlanar)
 
     The fields and behavior details of such formats are described below:
     
     [sampling ratio]
     ----------------
     The format begins with a three digit code commonly used for video formats that describes the relative frequencies with which luminance
     (Yp) and chrominance (Cb, Cr) are sampled, to enable rapid indexing of the formats for experienced professionals. For the rest of us,
     these are:
     
     444  Luminance and chrominance are sampled at the same rate
     422  Luminance is sampled at twice the rate of chrominance components in the horizontal dimension
     420  Luminance is sampled at twice the rate of chrominance components in both dimensions.
     ...
     
     If there is an alpha channel, it is assumed to be sampled at the same rate as luminance.
     
     [order of appearance of components in block]:
     --------------------------------------------
     For a 444 block, each component appears once and the block holds one pixel, so you
     just see the order of the components such as AYpCbCr much like we write ARGB. For a 422 block, there are two luminance for each Cb or Cr, so
     you will see a block order like YpCbYpCr and the block represents two pixels in a fully decoded image. Noticed that Yp is repeated twice.
     The pixels have different luminance but share the same chrominance values. In the case of 420 and 411, there is also vertical subsampling.
     In this case, the vImage_Buffer.rowBytes describes the stride from one block row to the next. (Each block row is two pixels tall.)
     
     In extreme cases with blocks that span more than two pixels, the block packing can become complicated, resulting in an exceptionally long name.
     This can happen for bit depths that are not a multiple of a byte, where the block size not only accommodates subsampling, but also byte alignment.  
     Such cases may be abbreviated with the P character, indicating Packed. An example is 422PCbYpCrYp10, which would otherwise have to be named 
     422CrYpCbYpCbYpCbYpCrYpCrYp10. In such cases, the actual layout is given in the comments.
     
 
     [bitdepth]
     ----------
     This is the number of bits per component. Typically, all the channels have the same bit depth so it just appears at the end of the plane name.
     If there is a heterogeneous format, the bit depths are inserted between the channels where they change (e.g. 444Yp12CbCr10) for 12 bit Yp and
     10 bit CbCr in a 32-bit 444 block.
     
     [additional planes]
     -------------------
     Some YpCbCr formats have multiple planes. (That is, multiple vImage_Buffers.) It is common to have the Y data in one plane and CbCr packed in
     another plane, or perhaps alpha stored  separately. An underbar _ shall separate the planes and the new plane will be named according to order
     of appearance of the block components. Subsampling may cause components in a plane to appear multiple times.  For example: 411YpYpCbYpYpCr8_AAAA8
     is a 411 format with alpha in a separate plane.  We see AAAA instead of A because each block holds 4 pixels and so the block contains alpha four
     times in that plane. Blocks in all planes have the same height and width for a particular format.
     
     
     Conversion to RGB and other colorspaces
     ----------------------------------------
     
     Unfortunately, the RGB colorspaces that commonly underlie YpCbCr formats are generally not the same as ones commonly used for RGB imaging in
     CoreGraphics. For example, ITU-R BT.709 is similar to sRGB but not the same. Consequently, simple conversion from YpCbCr data to RGB using
     the matrix functions provided here may not be the only step required for good color fidelity. A RGB -> RGB colorspace conversion may be
     required too.  Typically, this involves converting to linear color, applying a RGB->RGB conversion matrix, and then applying the new gamma.
     This can be done using vImagePiecewiseGamma_<fmt> and vImageMatrixMultiply_<fmt>. (We recommend planar 16Q12 for 8- and 10-bpc formats and
     floating point for higher bit depths.) However, some may find it simpler to use the interfaces on vImage_CVUtilities.h instead, which handle
     such details for you.

     YUV 420Yp8_Cb8_Cr8 can be used for 'y420' and 'f420' that are defined in CVPixelBuffer.h.
     
     For example, if we want to use this function to convert ARGB8888 to 'y420' with ITU 601 video range, then we need
     generate vImage_ARGBToYpCbCr by vImageConvert_ARGBToYpCbCr_GenerateConversion() and call this function.
 
     Yp_bias, CbCr_bias, CbCr_bias, R_Yp, G_Yp, B_Yp, R_Cb, G_Cb, B_Cb_R_Cr, G_Cr and B_Cr are calculated and
     converted into the right format by vImageConvert_ARGBToYpCbCr_GenerateConversion() inside of vImage_ARGBToYpCbCr.

     Values that can be used to switch the channel order of dest.
     For exmaple, permuteMap[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3} or NULL are ARGB8888.
     permuteMap[4] = {3, 2, 1, 0} is BGRA8888.
     Any order of permuteMap is allowed when each permuteMap value is 0, 1, 2, or 3, as long as the channels don't repeat. For example, the pirate colorspace {0,1,1,1} (ARRR) is not supported, because the red channel appears more than once. (Pirates see red.)

     YUV 420Yp8_CbCr8 can be used for '420v' and '420f' that are defined in CVPixelBuffer.h.
     
     For example, if we want to use this function to convert ARGB8888 to '420v' with ITU 601 video range, then we need
     generate vImage_ARGBToYpCbCr by vImageConvert_ARGBToYpCbCr_GenerateConversion() and call this function.
 
     Yp_bias, CbCr_bias, CbCr_bias, R_Yp, G_Yp, B_Yp, R_Cb, G_Cb, B_Cb_R_Cr, G_Cr and B_Cr are calculated and
     converted into the right format by vImageConvert_ARGBToYpCbCr_GenerateConversion() inside of vImage_ARGBToYpCbCr.

     YUV 422CrYpCbYpCbYpCbYpCrYpCrYp10 can be used for 'v210' that is defined in CVPixelBuffer.h.
     
     For example, if we want to use this function to convert ARGB8888 to 'v210' with ITU 601 video range, then we need
     generate vImage_YpCbCrToARGB by vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion() and call this function.
     
     Yp_bias, CbCr_bias, CbCr_bias, Yp, Cr_R, Cb_G, Cr_G, and Cb_B are calculated and converted into the right
     format by vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion() inside of vImage_YpCbCrToARGB.

     YUV 422CrYpCbYpCbYpCbYpCrYpCrYp10 can be used for 'v210' that is defined in CVPixelBuffer.h.
     
     For example, if we want to use this function to convert ARGB16Q12 to 'v210' with ITU 601 video range, then we need
     generate vImage_YpCbCrToARGB by vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion() and call this function.
     
     Yp_bias, CbCr_bias, CbCr_bias, Yp, Cr_R, Cb_G, Cr_G, and Cb_B are calculated and converted into the right
     format by vImageConvert_YpCbCrToARGB_GenerateConversion() inside of vImage_YpCbCrToARGB.

     Yp_bias, CbCr_bias, CbCr_bias, R_Yp, G_Yp, B_Yp, R_Cb, G_Cb, B_Cb_R_Cr, G_Cr and B_Cr are calculated and
     converted into the right format by vImageConvert_ARGBToYpCbCr_GenerateConversion() inside of vImage_ARGBToYpCbCr.

     Note: vImage doesn't do anything with the alpha here. It is just thrown away. The operation is therefore best suited for kCGImageAlphaNoneSkip<First/Last>
           images.  If it has alpha, you may wish to composite against an opaque background first, before the transparency information is lost.
           If it is premultiplied by alpha, you at minimum should unpremultiply it first, or composite it against an opaque background. See
           vImageUnpremultiplyData_ARGB16U() and vImageFlatten_ARGB16U().

 *
 *  @discussion vImage_CVUtilities.h provides a suite of high level APIs to facilitate conversion between CVPixelBufferRef
 *  formats and the set of formats describable by CoreGraphics types, including the core formats used by vImage for most
 *  image filters.  The API should support nearly any CoreVideo format or Core Graphics format in a generic (format neutral)
 *  manner.  Conversions by default are color corrected as necessary.  (The recipe for the correction is taken from ColorSync
 *  but vImage does the heavy lifting, usually running from 3-156 times faster.)  High level interfaces are available to 
 *  read/write data directly to/from CVPixelBufferRefs to vImage_Buffers.  Lower level interfaces are provided to allow the
 *  process to be broken apart a bit, to either respond to errors or eliminate redundant calculation. That is, while it is 
 *  expected that the high level interfaces above will work for most, there are two common situation where more work may be required:
 *
 *  Sometimes CVPixelBuffers are missing information attached to them that is needed to convert them to other formats. The vImageCVImageFormatRef
 *  allows you to repair this problem prior to proceeding with conversions using the above high level interfaces or vImageConvert_AnyToAny.
 *  The vImageCVImageFormatRef also provides additional control over how the conversion is done.
 *
 *  In addition, when the same conversion is done repeatedly, such as when converting multiple frames from the same movie, the high level interfaces
 *  presented above may incur some unnecessary overhead because they are redundantly introspecting pixel format and creating/destroying the same
 *  objects over and over. Breaking apart the conversion process into substeps allows you to recycle work from earlier conversions to save time.
 *  Both vImageCVImageFormatRefs and vImageConverterRefs can be reused multiple times, by multiple threads concurrently, if needed.
 *
 *  In addition, please see the various RGB <-> CoreVideo basic conversions are available in vImage/Conversion.h.  These provide direct
 *  access to the fast low level conversions available here. They are useful when you know exactly what formats you are working
 *  with ahead of time and just want to do that with a minimum of fuss.

 *
 *      @param cvPixelBuffer    A CVPixelBufferRef for the image. It is not necessary to lock the CVPixelBuffer before calling this function.

 *                                      When the kvImageDoNotAllocate flag is set, the buffer->data pointer and buffer->rowBytes is used unmodified.  
 *                                      This is intended to allow you to allocate the buffer yourself, or write directly into part of another image.
 *                                      Use CVPixelBufferGetHeight() and CVPixelBufferGetWidth() to find the size of the result buffer.
 *
 *          kvImageDoNotTile            Disable internal multithreading. This may be desired if you are extracting many
 *                                      such images in parallel, or are otherwise attempting to keep CPU utilization to

 *                                              This is useful for debugging, but probably should not be on for a shipping application.

/*!
 * @function vImageBuffer_CopyToCVPixelBuffer
 * @abstract Copies the contents of the vImage_Buffer to a CVPixelBufferRef.
 * @discussion If the format of the vImage_Buffer doesn't match the CVPixelBuffer format, the image will be converted to the CVPixelBuffer 
 *              format as part of the copy.
 *
 *  The entire CVPixelBuffer is overwritten. If you want to copy less, you can do so using vImageConvert_AnyToAny and a converter prepared
 *  with vImageConverter_CreateForCFToCVImageFormat.
 *
 *  vImage here conforms to CoreVideo practice of substituting gamma 1/1.961 for kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_ITU_R_709_2 and
 *  kCVImageBufferTransferFunction_SMPTE_240M_1995 instead of using the ITU-R BT.709-5 specified transfer function.  You may
 *  manually set the transfer function using vImageCreateRGBColorSpaceWithPrimariesAndTransferFunction() and vImageCVImageFormat_SetColorSpace().
 *  ImageCreateRGBColorSpaceWithPrimariesAndTransferFunction() does not make this substitution.
 *
 *
 *      @param buffer          A pointer to a vImage_Buffer containing the pixels to be copied (converted) to the CVPixelBuffer. May not be NULL.
 *
 *      @param bufferFormat    The format of buffer. May not be NULL.
 *
 *      @param cvPixelBuffer   The CVPixelBufferRef where the image will be written.  It should be a valid, preallocated CVPixelBufferRef
 *                      set to the desired image type (which need not match bufferFormat).  It is not necessary to lock the 
 *                      CVPixelBuffer before calling this function. May not be NULL.
 *
 *      @param cvImageFormat   An optional vImageCVImageFormatRef to specify the pixel format of the CVPixelBuffer.
 *
 *                      If NULL, vImage attempts to discover this information automatically. However, sometimes necessary color information
 *                      in the CVPixelBuffer is missing, preventing conversion.  An error will be returned. See kvImageCVImageFormat return 
 *                      codes for this function for more information. To supply vImage with complete color information, provide a complete 
 *                      vImageCVImageFormatRef here.
 *
 *                      If not NULL, the cvImageFormat is used instead of looking to the CVPixelBufferRef for color information. If the 
 *                      cvImageFormat is also incomplete, a kvImageCVImageFormat_ error code will be returned.
 *
 *                          CAUTION: In this case, it is your responsibility to make sure that the CVPixelBuffer has the right 
 *                                   attachments for matrix, chroma siting and colorspace as necessary to be properly decoded.
 *                                   vImage does not set these things for you.
 *
 *      @param backgroundColor If bufferFormat->bitmapInfo encodes kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst,
 *                      kCGImageAlphaLast or kCGImageAlphaFirst -- that is, has a real alpha channel -- and the CVPixelBuffer
 *                      does not (most CV pixel formats don't) then the image will be flattened against a solid color to remove
 *                      the alpha information. You can select which color that is here. The background color is a CGFloat[3] 
 *                      (red, green, blue) in the RGB colorspace of the CVPixelBuffer. (YpCbCr images reference a RGB colorspace
 *                      through a matrix like ITU-709. That is the RGB colorspace we are talking about here.)  
 *
 *                      This parameter may be NULL, indicating black. 
 *
 *                      If you want to skip flattening, you can substitute in kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst/Last for the encoding of
 *                      the input buffer. This may lead to undesired results in the case of premultiplied alpha however, when alpha 
 *                      is not all either 1.0 or 0. In that case, unpremultiply it first as a separate pass. Unpremultiplication may 
 *                      be more costly than just flattening it, but does not introduce regions of background color into the image.
 *
 *      @param flags           The following flags are understood by this function:
 *
 *          <pre>
 *          @textblock
 *          kvImageNoFlags                      Default operation.
 *
 *          kvImageDoNotTile                    Turn internal multithreading off. This may be helpful in cases where you already have
 *                                              many such operations going concurrently, and in cases where it is desirable to keep
 *                                              CPU utilization to a single core.
 *
 *          kvImageHighQualityResampling        For some CVPixelBuffer formats, the chroma channels are subsampled. This flag directs
 *                                              vImage to spend extra time where it can to give better image quality.
 *
 *          kvImagePrintDiagnosticsToConsole    In case of an error, print human readable error messages to the Apple System Logger (Console).
 *                                              This is useful for debugging, but probably should not be on for a shipping application.
 *          @/textblock

 *          @textblock
 *          kvImageNoError                          Success
 *
 *          kvImageInvalidImageFormat               bufferFormat is NULL or encodes an invalid format
 *
 *          kvImageBufferSizeMismatch               buffer and cvPixelBuffer are not the same height and width
 *
 *          kvImageNullPointerArgument              buffer and cvPixelBuffer may not be NULL
 *
 *          kvImageCVImageFormat_ConversionMatrix   The conversion matrix is missing from the CVPixelBuffer / vImageCVImageFormatRef. See note below.
 *
 *          kvImageCVImageFormat_ChromaSiting       The chroma siting info is missing from the CVPixelBuffer / vImageCVImageFormatRef. See note below.
 *
 *          kvImageCVImageFormat_ColorSpace         The colorspace containing primaries and transfer function is missing from the CVPixelBuffer / vImageCVImageFormatRef.
 *          @/textblock
 *          </pre>
 *
 *          Note: Some CVPixelBuffers have incompletely specified color information. This makes it impossible for vImage to do the conversion.
 *            When this happens, you will get one of the kvImageCVImageFormat_ errors above. To proceed, create a vImageCVImageFormatRef, add
 *            the missing information and pass as the cvImageFormat parameter. It is possible that more than one piece of information is missing.

/*!
 * @function vImageCVImageFormat_Create
 * @abstract Create a vImageCVImageFormatRef (low level).
 * @discussion This function creates a vImageCVImageFormatRef from first principles. In most cases, vImageCVImageFormat_CreateWithCVPixelBuffer
 *              is easier, but if your video pipeline doesn't use CoreVideo, or you need absolute control then this is your alternative.
 *
 *              Other fields not given by function parameters like number of channels, channel names, and channel description are automatically 
 *              configured using the imageFormatType. User data is set separately with vImageCVImageFormat_SetUserData.
 *
 *
 * @param imageFormatType       A CVPixelFormatType such as '2vuy'. See CVPixelBuffer.h for the complete list.
 *
 * @param  matrix               A vImage_ARGBToYpCbCrMatrix showing how to convert from RGB to the YpCbCr format. This may be NULL. However, it
 *                              is required for conversions involving YpCbCr images, so for YpCbCr images you will be eventually forced to set the matrix
 *                              using vImageCVImageFormat_CopyConversionMatrix before you can make a vImageConverterRef with this object.  
 *                              There are some predefined conversion matrices in Conversion.h for Rec 601 and 709 formats.
 *
 * @param  cvImageBufferChromaLocation   See kCVImageBufferChromaLocationTopFieldKey in CVImageBuffer.h for a list of chroma locations.
 *                              kCVImageBufferChromaLocation_Center is typical.  This may be NULL. However, for YpCbCr formats with downsampled
 *                              chroma, you will be ultimately forced to set a chroma location using vImageCVImageFormat_SetChromaSiting, before
 *                              a vImageConverterRef can be made with this object.
 *
 * @param  baseColorspace       For RGB and monochrome images, this is the colorspace of the image.
 *
 *                              For YpCbCr images, this is the colorspace of the RGB image before it was converted to YpCbCr using the ARGB-to-YpCbCr
 *                              conversion matrix (see matrix parameter above). The colorspace is defined based on the YpCbCr format RGB primaries
 *                              and transfer function.
 *
 *                              This may be NULL. However, you will eventually be forced to set set a colorspace for all image types, before
 *                              a vImageConvertRef can be made with this object.
 *
 * @param  alphaIsOneHint       Typically this is 0. If your image format has an alpha channel, but you know the image is fully opaque,
 *                              or want it to be treated as opaque, you can set this to 1. This may allow for faster conversions to
 *                              opaque formats.
 *
 *
 * @return
 *   On success, a non-NULL vImageCVImageFormatRef will be returned, which encodes the information contained in the above parameters. The 
 *   vImageCVImageFormatRef has a retain count of 1.  You must release it when you are done with it.
 *
 *   On failure, NULL is returned.

 *              also happen by design as the result of something like vImageCVImageFormat_SetColorSpace(fmt, NULL). When

 *              (e.g. vImageBuffer_InitWithCVPixelBuffer). In such cases, a vImageCVImageFormatError will be returned
 *              from the left hand side of the function to indicate which field is absent.
 *
 *  @constant   kvImageCVImageFormat_NoError    No error. The conversion was successfully completed. 
 *
 *  @constant   kvImageCVImageFormat_ConversionMatrix The conversion matrix is absent and required. The conversion matrix
 *              provides the conversion from RGB to Y'CbCr.
 *
 *  @constant   kvImageCVImageFormat_ChromaSiting  The chroma siting information is absent.  Chroma siting indicates the position
 *              of chrominance information relative to luminance samples when chrominance is sub-sampled. 
 *
 *  @constant   kvImageCVImageFormat_ColorSpace The colorspace of the image is missing. If Y'CbCr, this is the colorspace of the
 *              RGB image from which the Y'CbCr pixels were calculated. Otherwise, it is the colorspace of the pixels themselves. 
 *              Most CVPixelBuffer formats only allow one or two colorspace models (e.g. kCGColorSpaceModelRGB)
 *
 *  @constant   kvImageCVImageFormat_VideoChannelDescription    The range and clipping information is missing. This is unlikely
 *              to occur, since the information is initialized automatically based on the imageFormatType (See vImageCVImageFormat_Create.)
 *
 *  @constant   kvImageCVImageFormat_AlphaIsOneHint    The alpha-is-one hint tells vImage that the alpha channel (if any) is opaque.

 * @discussion 16Q12 data is a signed 16-bit fixed point integer. The format is implicitly divided by 2**12
 *             to give a range of [-8,8)  (SHRT_MIN/4096,SHRT_MAX/4096). The type is present to allow 
 *             8-bit content to be converted into other colorspaces and operated on without undue
 *             loss of precision or loss of color gamut due to clamping. This constant is "magic" in the
 *             sense that it is identified by address. Copying the values here will cause a CG format to
 *             be instead interpreted as a _unsigned_ 16 bit format. 
 *
 *             16Q12 pixels do not follow CG image format conventions in two respects. The format is signed.
 *             The alpha channel is subject to the decode array transform too, meaning that 0 is transparent 
 *             and 4096 opaque. Consequently, ALL buffers that use this format must be tagged with the 
 *             kvImageDecodeArray_16Q12Format decode array.

 * @abstract A pixel format
 * @discussion A vImage_CGImageFormat describes the ordering of the color channels, how many there are,
 * the size and type of the data in the color channels and whether the data is premultiplied by alpha or not.
 * This format mirrors the image format descriptors used by CoreGraphics to create things like CGImageRef and
 * CGBitmapContextRef.
 *
 * This vImage_CGImageFormat:

 *
 * codes for a little endian ARGB8888 pixel, or what is called in the rest of vImage, BGRA8888. Note: for 16-
 * and 32-bits per component formats (int16_t, uint16_t, half-float, float) most vImage image filters assume
 * the data is in host-endian format. (The APIs in this header do not.) Host-endian is little endian for Intel
 * and ARM, big endian for PowerPC. If the data is not in host-endian format, then you may use
 * vImagePermuteChannels_ARGB8888 or vImageByteSwap_Planar16U to swap the image data byte ordering.
 *
 * Some examples:
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *      ARGB8888     ->  {8, 32, NULL, alpha first, 0, NULL, kCGRenderingIntentDefault}     alpha first = { kCGImageAlphaFirst, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst, kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst }

 *      RGBA16F      ->  {16, 64, NULL, alpha last | kCGBitmapFloatComponents | kCGBitmapByteOrder16Little, 0, NULL, kCGRenderingIntentDefault }
 *      CMYK8888     ->  {8, 32, CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceCMYK(), kCGImageAlphaNone, 0, NULL, kCGRenderingIntentDefault  }
 *      ARGBFFFF premultiplied    ->  {32, 128, NULL, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst | kCGBitmapFloatComponents | kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little, 0, NULL, kCGRenderingIntentDefault }
 *      ARGBFFFF not-premultiplied -> {32, 128, NULL, kCGImageAlphaFirst | kCGBitmapFloatComponents | kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little, 0, NULL, kCGRenderingIntentDefault }

 *
 *  Note that some of these formats, particularly RGB565 and 16F formats are supported by vImage but
 *  not necessarily CoreGraphics. They will be converted to a higher precision format as necessary by
 *  vImage in vImageCreateCGImageFromBuffer().
 *
 *  By C rules, uninitialized struct parameters are set to zero. The last three parameters are usually zero, so can usually be omitted.
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *      vImage_CGImageFormat srgb888 = (vImage_CGImageFormat){
 *          .bitsPerComponent = 8,

 *
 * To understand how these various parameters relate to one another, we can look at the process of converting from
 * one vImage_CGImageFormat format to another:
 *
 *  1) transform endianness of src format given by bitmapInfo to host endian  (except 8 bitPerComponent content)
 *  2) remove decode array transformation, and up convert to a higher range format as necessary to preserve precision / range
 *  3) convert src colorspace to reference XYZ colorspace (may cause upconvert to preserve range / precision)
 *  4) convert XYZ to destination colorspace + rendering intent
 *  5) convert to destination precision (given by bitsPerComponent)
 *  6) deal with any alpha changes (given by bitmapInfo) or flattening that needs to occur
 *  7) Apply any channel reordering requested, if it didn't happen at an earlier step. (As indicated by src and dest bitmapInfo)
 *  8) Apply destination decode array
 *  9) Apply endianness transform given by dest bitmapInfo
 *
 * Clearly, for most common transformations not all steps need to occur and multiple steps can be collapsed into a compound operation.
 *
 *  @field  bitsPerComponent    The number of bits needed to represent one channel of data in one pixel. For ARGB8888, this would be 8. Expected values: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 32}
 *  @field  bitsPerPixel        The number of bits needed to represent one pixel. For ARGB8888, this would be 32.
 *                              It is possible that bitsPerPixel > bitsPerComponent * number of components, but in practice this is rare.
 *                              The number of color components is given by the colorspace and the number of alpha components (0 or 1) is given by
 *                              by the bitmapInfo.
 *  @field  colorSpace          A description of how the pixel data in the image is positioned relative to a reference XYZ color space.
 *                                  See CoreGraphics/CGColorSpace.h.  Pass NULL as a shorthand for sRGB. The vImage_CGImageFormat is not
 *                                  capable of managing the memory held by the colorSpace. If you created the colorspace, you must
 *                                  be sure to release it before all references to it disappear from scope.
 *  @field  bitmapInfo          The CGBitmapInfo describing the color channels. See CoreGraphics/CGImage.h.
 *                                  ARGB8888 is kCGImageAlphaFirst | kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault
 *                                  BGRA8888 is kCGImageAlphaFirst | kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little
 *  @field  version             The struct is versioned for future expansion.  Pass 0 here.

 /*!
 *  @function vImageBuffer_Init
 *  @abstract Convenience function to allocate a vImage_Buffer of desired size
 *  @discussion This function is a convenience method to help initialize a vImage_Buffer struct with a buffer sized
 *  and aligned for best performance. It will initialize the height, width and rowBytes fields, and allocate 
 *  the pixel storage for you. You are responsible for releasing the memory pointed to by buf->data back to 
 *  the system when you are done with it using free(). If no such allocation is desired, pass  
 *  kvImageNoAllocate in the flags to cause buf->data to be set to NULL and the preferred alignment 
 *  to be returned from the left hand side of the function.
 *
 *  Here is an example of typical usage:
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *      vImage_Buffer buf;
 *      vImage_Error err = vImageBuffer_Init( &buf, height, width, 8 * sizeof(pixel), kvImageNoFlags);
 *      ...
 *  @/textblock</pre>
 *
 *  And typical usage using your own allocator (posix_memalign in this case):
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *      vImage_Buffer buf;
 *      ssize_t alignment = vImageBuffer_Init( &buf, height, width, 8 * sizeof(pixel), kvImageNoAllocate);
 *      if( alignment >= 0 )  // <0 is an error
 *          error = posix_memalign( &buf.data, alignment, buf.height * buf.rowBytes );  // An allocator
 *  @/textblock</pre>
 *
 *      On return, buf is initialized to contain the provided height and width and best rowBytes for the image.
 *      buf->data will also be allocated by default. If kvImageNoAllocate is passed then allocation is skipped,
 *      buf->data is set to NULL, and the preferred alignment is returned out the left hand side of the
 *      function.
 *
 *  @param buf              A valid empty vImage_Buffer struct. On return, all fields will be initialized.
 *                          Please see behavior of kvImageNoAllocate in the flags parameter below.
 *
 *  @param height           The desired height of the image
 *  @param width            The desired width of the image
 *
 *  @param pixelBits        The number of bits in a pixel of image data. If the image is in a planar format
 *                          then this is the number of bits per color component. If pixelBits is not divisible
 *                          by 8, then vImage will pad the scanline out to a multiple of a byte so that
 *                          two scanlines can not share the same byte and all scanlines start at the start of 
 *                          a byte.
 *
 *  @param flags            Must be from the following list:
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *                          kvImageNoAllocate -- on return buf->data is initialized to NULL. A preferred
 *                              alignment suitable for use with posix_memalign is returned out the left hand 
 *                              side of the function and buf->rowBytes will be set to the preferred rowBytes. 
 *                              If the left hand side return is negative, it is an error code, not a size. 
 *                          
 *                              If the kvImageNoAllocate flag is not passed, then on return buf->data will point 
 *                              to a newly allocated buffer with preferred alignment and rowBytes. An appropriate 
 *                              error code will be returned from the left hand side.
 *
 *                          kvImagePrintDiagnosticsToConsole -- directs the function to print diagnostic information
 *                              to the console in the event of failure.

 * @function vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage
 * @abstract Initialize a vImage_Buffer struct with the contents of a CGImageRef
 * @discussion This function will initialize a vImage_Buffer struct with an image from a CGImageRef.
 * By default, a new region of memory to hold the image data will be allocated by this function.  You may
 * optionally allocate the memory region yourself by passing in the kvImageNoAllocate flag. 
 *
 * You may release the CGImageRef and format->colorspace upon successful return of this function.
 *
 * You are responsible for returning the memory referenced by buf->data to the system using free() when you are done with it.
 * The CGImage may have other metadata associated with it, such as camera orientiation, which may require further
 * processing downstream.  vImage just does 1:1 pixel conversions from the raw image source.
 *
 *
 * To create a CGImageRef from a image file on disk:
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *     CFURLRef path = ...;  // path to image
 *     CGImageSourceRef imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL( path, optionsDictionary ); // optionsDictionary may be NULL
 *     CGImageRef imageRef = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex( imageSource, imageIndex, optionsDictionary );
 *  @/textblock</pre>
 *
 * Similarly, with a chunk of compressed image data in memory:
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *     CFDataRef data = ...;
 *     CGImageSourceRef imageSource = CGImageSourceCreateWithData( path, optionsDictionary );
 *     CGImageRef imageRef = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex( imageSource, imageIndex, optionsDictionary );
 *  @/textblock</pre>
 *
 * You can do similar things through AppKit / UIKit with [NSImage initWithContentsOfFile:],
 * [NSImage initWithContentsOfURL:], or [NSImage initWithData:],  and use [NSImage CGImageForProposedRect:context:hints:]
 * to get out a CGImageRef.
 *
 * @param buf   A pointer to a valid vImage_Buffer struct. The fields of the structure pointed to by buf will
 *              be updated to point to a vImage_Buffer representation of the CGImage. By default, a newly
 *              allocated piece of memory will be used to hold the image. You are responsible
 *              for releasing the memory pointed to by buf->data back to the system using free().
 *
 *                  If you want to allocate the buf->data and initialize rowBytes yourself, then you may pass 
 *                  kvImageNoAllocate in the flags parameter. This will cause the buf->data and rowBytes values  
 *                  passed into the function to be used directly without modification.  You may find vImageBuffer_Init,  
 *                  vImageCGImageFormat_GetPixelBits, CGImageGetWidth and CGImageGetHeight helpful in sizing your buffer.
 *
 * @param format  A pointer to a valid vImage_CGImageFormat specifying the desired image format associated with the 
 *                  output buf. If format->colorspace is NULL, sRGB will be used.
 *
 * @param backgroundColor If the CGImageRef encodes an alpha (or mask) and the output format does not have alpha then the
 *                  result will be flattened against a background color. See vImageConverter_CreateWithCGImageFormat
 *                  and functions like vImageFlatten_ARGB8888ToRGB888 for more on flattening. The background color here is
 *                  a series of values of range [0,1] interpreted according to the colorspace passed in format. Example: If 
 *                  the format encodes for a AGBR 8-bit image (kCGImageAlphaLast, kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little), then this would be
 *                  {red, green, blue}, the canonical ordering for a RGB colorspace, as an array of three CGFloats.  
 *                  If NULL is passed, an array full of zeros is used. The backgroundColor must have at least as many
 *                  CGFloats in it as the colorspace has color channels. See CGColorSpaceGetNumberOfComponents.
 *
 * @param image     A valid CGImageRef to be used as source data.
 *
 * @param flags     You may set the following flags:
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *                  kvImageNoAllocate       the buf->data and buf->rowBytes values passed in are used without modification.
 *                                          This allows you to allocate your own buffer to hold the result. See buf description
 *                                          above.
 *
 *                  kvImagePrintDiagnosticsToConsole    In the event of a problem, print out some helpful debug messages.
 *
 *                  kvImageDoNoTile         It is possible that vImage will have to do an image format conversion from the
 *                                          image native format to the desired format. This will turn off multithreading for
 *                                          that step and any other vImage work that is multithreaded. Since any such conversions
 *                                          are likely happening outside your tiling engine, use of this flag here is 
 *                                          probably counterproductive. In rare cases, it might be valuable as a method to

 *                                          sensitive tasks running. Likewise, if you are converting multiple images concurrently,

 * @function vImageCreateCGImageFromBuffer
 * @abstract Create a CGImageRef from a vImage_Buffer.
 * @discussion This function creates a CGImageRef using the image data in a vImage_Buffer. The CGImageRef has a retain count of 1.
 * By default, a copy of the image data is made. This allows the function to convert to a CG-friendly format as necessary
 * and allows you to continue to use the vImage_Buffer without causing problems for the CGImageRef. 
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 * No copy mode
 * ------------
 * When the kvImageNoAllocate flag is passed, then "no-copy" operation is said to occur. Ownership of the memory region  
 * pointed to by buf->data is transferred to the CGImageRef and it becomes private to and owned by that object and will 
 * be used without modification. The memory region pointed to by buf->data will be destroyed when the CGImageRef is 
 * destroyed. Caution: CGImageRefs are defined to be immutable once created. Behavior is undefined if you create
 * a CGImageRef then modify the pixels in its backing store.
 *
 * No-copy mode can be a little fussy about formats. When a format is rejected, kvImageInvalidImageFormat will be returned. 
 * Formats that are likely to succeed are 8-bit unsigned, 16-bit unsigned and 32-bit floating-point. The image should be 
 * kCGImageAlphaNone, kCGImageAlphaLast, kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast or kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipLast, and decode = NULL. 
 * The image should be in host endian mode. This is kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault for 8-bit per component images, and or larger 
 * types, the endianness is given by the endianness of the host system and the size is given by the size of the pixel 
 * (bitsPerComponent < 8) or channel (bitsPerComponent > 8). For example RGB565 data should be kCGBitmapByteOrder16Little 
 * and 32-bit floating point data should be kCGBitmapByteOrder32Little on little endian processors. 
 *
 * It is recommended that if no-copy mode fails, that you try again without the kvImageNoAllocate flag. The call probably 
 * will succeed.
 *  @/textblock </pre>
 *
 * CGImage Debugging Note:
 *      The format parameter describes the image data you pass in, but there is no requirement that this is the
 *      format that is actually used to represent the image data held by the CGImage. You should be able to get
 *      back the data in any format you like with vImageBuffer_InitWithCGImage. However, understand that if you
 *      request the data through another API like CGDataProviderCopyData(), it will be formatted as described by
 *      that API -- for CGDataProviderCopyData(), that would be as described by: CGImageGetBitmapInfo, CGImageGetDecode,
 *      CGImageGetRenderingIntent, CGImageGetColorSpace, CGImageGetBytesPerRow, CGImageGetBitsPerPixel,
 *      CGImageGetBitsPerComponent, etc.  Furthermore, the format that those APIs report is also not necessarily
 *      the format of the data held by the CGImageRef.  Common image data consumers like CoreAnimation and
 *      CoreGraphics have their format preferences and vImage caters to them in order to deliver good performance.
 *
 *      CGImageRefs can also be made from vImage_Buffers using CGImageCreate() and CGDataProviderCreateWithData().
 *
 *  @param buf             The vImage_Buffer from which to make the CGImageRef
 *
 *  @param format          The image format of the vImage_Buffer. format may not be NULL.  format->colorspace may be NULL,
 *                  in which case sRGB will be used.  The colorspace is retained as needed by the new CGImage.
 *
 *  @param callback        In no-copy mode, this callback is called to destroy the buf->data when the CGImageRef no longer needs it.
 *                  If NULL is passed for the callback, then free() will be used to destroy buf->data.  userData will be 
 *                  passed to the callback function as the userData parameter and buf->data passed as the buf_data parameter.
 *
 *                  This parameter has no effect if kvImageNoAllocate is not in flags. 
 *
 *                  The callback may be called at any time from any thread. It is possible for it to be called before 
 *                  vImageCreateCGImageFromBuffer returns.  
 *
 *                  The callback will not be called if the returned CGImageRef is NULL.
 *

 *              to be used (and reused, possibly reentrantly) with vImageConvert_AnyToAny() to convert 
 *              images from one format to another.
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *  Image Format Notes:
 *      CG Integer images map the range [0,1.0] (black to full color intensity) to the range [0, TYPE_MAX]. A 8-bit unsigned image
 *  has a range [0,255] and a 16-bit signed image has a range [0,32767]. Floating point images map [0,1.0] to [0,1.0]. Some formats,
 *  like floating-point and signed integers are capable of representing values outside of that range. Conversions involving these
 *  formats will occasionally produce results outside of [0,1]. If the conversion causes a value to go out of the representable range
 *  for the underlying type, it will be clamped to the nearest representable value. This can happen in normal operation during color
 *  correction. You can clamp floating-point results back into [0,1] using vImageClip_PlanarF, if you like.
 *
 *      Usually, colors must be direct mapped. Indexed color is supported format->bitsPerComponent and format->.bitsPerPixel are 1,2,4
 *  or 8, and equal (i.e. grayscale) only. Indexed color is not supported for the destination image. Images with indexed color must use
 *  (kCGImageAlphaNone | kCGBitmapByteOrderDefault) as the bitmapInfo. It is usually faster with indexed color spaces to use
 *  vImageConvert_AnyToAny to convert the color table rather than the image itself when possible, because the table is usually much
 *  smaller than the image. vImageConvert_AnyToAny can not do that automatically for you behind the scenes because it does not return
 *  a modified colorspace.
 *
 *  Device Colorspaces:
 *  Because vImage has no concept of a rendering context or destination graphics device, vImage maps device RGB, device grayscale
 *  and device CMYK to a virtual device which is not your display. The virtual device uses kColorSyncGenericGrayGamma22Profile,
 *  kColorSyncSRGBProfile and kColorSyncGenericCMYKProfile respectively. If you want the image to be converted to the right colorspace
 *  for your display device, you will need to pass in the CGColorSpaceRef for that device obtained from an API like CGDisplayCopyColorSpace().
 *
 *  Black Point Compensation:
 *  By default, BPC is off for this function. If you want black point compensation or other advanced ColorSync effects, construct your
 *  own ColorSyncTransformRef and pass the associated "code fragment" to vImageConverter_CreateWithColorSyncCodeFragment.
 *  See Apple Sample Code "Converting an Image with Black Point Compensation" https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/convertImage/Introduction/Intro.html

 *                      as the default value. The CGColorSpaceRef will be retained by this function. It
 *                      will be released when the vImageConverter is destroyed.

 *
 *  @param  backgroundColor Points to an array of floats to be used as a background color if one is needed. The
 *                      backgroundColor range is assumed to be [0,1]. The channel ordering and number of color 
 *                      channels must match the natural order of the destination colorSpace (e.g. RGB or CMYK). 
 *                      The backgroundColor may be NULL if no background color is needed. 
 *
 *                      A background color is used when the image is converted from an alpha-containing format 
 *                      to an alpha-none format, in which case the alpha is removed by compositing against the 
 *                      opaque background color pointed to by this parameter. If the image is instead converted

 *                      unpremultiplied as necessary and no background color is necessary. (For unpremultiplication, 
 *                      the result color value for pixels with alpha 0 is 0.)  Likewise, when converting between
 *                      alpha-none formats, a background color is not use. In the case of kCGImageAlphaNone ->

 *  @discussion These functions describe the identity of each buffer passed in the srcs parameters of vImageConvert_AnyToAny,
 *  to allow you to order the buffers correctly. It is provided for informational purposes, to help wire up image 
 *  processing pipelines to vImage that are not supported through more direct means, CGImages, CVPixelBuffers, the alternative
 *  handling of which is described at the end of this comment.
 *
 *  Prior to OS X.10 and iOS 8.0, only CG Image formats are handled by vImageConvert_AnyToAny. Had these functions existed
 *  then, the result would always be {kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat, kvImageBufferTypeCode_EndOfList}
 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *  Simplified Common Cases
 *  -----------------------
 *    CGImageRefs:
 *      CoreGraphics formats always come as a single buffer, with one or more channels. No buffer ordering is
 *      requred. The buffer order is always kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat. Prior to OS X.10 and iOS 8.0, only
 *      converters to CG image formats are available, so where these functions are not available, the answer would
 *      have always been { kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat, 0}. As a point of trivia, the ordering of the channels
 *      within a buffer is by convention as follows:
 *
 *              number of channels = number of channels in colorspace + (alpha != kCGImageAlphaNone)
 *              alpha is either first or last, given by the alpha component of the CGBitmapInfo
 *              The ordering of the non-alpha channels is given by the colorspace, e.g. {R,G,B} for a RGB image.
 *              For 8-bit images, the ordering of the channels may be reversed according to
 *                  kCGBitmapByteOrderLittleEndian32 or kCGBitmapByteOrderLittleEndian16, but
 *                  the pixel size must match the endian swap chunk size. This gives you access to formats
 *                  like BGRA8888. If the endian is default or big endian, then no swap occurs.
 *
 *    CVPixelBufferRefs:
 *      Though these APIs will work for this purpose, it is expected to be simpler to use vImageBuffer_InitForCopyToCVPixelBuffer
 *      or vImageBuffer_InitForCopyFromCVPixelBuffer to set up a vImage_Buffer array for srcs and dests. Pass kvImageDoNotAllocate
 *      to have it automatically alias a locked CVPixelBuffer. The conversion will then copy the data right into or out of the
 *      CVPixelBuffer without further copying or modification.  (It may still need to be copied out to the GPU, for example, however.)

 *
 *  <pre>@textblock
 *  Simplified Common Cases
 *  -----------------------
 *    CGImageRefs:
 *      CoreGraphics formats always come as a single buffer, with one or more channels. No buffer ordering is
 *      requred. The buffer order is always kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat. Prior to OS X.10 and iOS 8.0, only
 *      converters to CG image formats are available, so where these functions are not available, the answer would
 *      have always been { kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat, 0}. As a point of trivia, the ordering of the channels
 *      within a buffer is by convention as follows:
 *
 *              number of channels = number of channels in colorspace + (alpha != kCGImageAlphaNone)
 *              alpha is either first or last, given by the alpha component of the CGBitmapInfo
 *              The ordering of the non-alpha channels is given by the colorspace, e.g. {R,G,B} for a RGB image.
 *              For 8-bit images, the ordering of the channels may be reversed according to
 *                  kCGBitmapByteOrderLittleEndian32 or kCGBitmapByteOrderLittleEndian16, but
 *                  the pixel size must match the endian swap chunk size. This gives you access to formats
 *                  like BGRA8888. If the endian is default or big endian, then no swap occurs.
 *
 *    CVPixelBufferRefs:
 *      Though these APIs will work for this purpose, it is expected to be simpler to use vImageBuffer_InitForCopyToCVPixelBuffer
 *      or vImageBuffer_InitForCopyFromCVPixelBuffer to set up a vImage_Buffer array for srcs and dests. Pass kvImageDoNotAllocate
 *      to have it automatically alias a locked CVPixelBuffer. The conversion will then copy the data right into or out of the
 *      CVPixelBuffer without further copying or modification.  (It may still need to be copied out to the GPU, for example, however.)

 *
 *  @abstract Use a vImageConverterRef to convert the pixels in a vImage_Buffer to another format
 *
 *  @discussion With an appropriately configured vImageConverter, convert the image channels found in srcs
 *  to the image channels found in dests. Whenever possible, conversion passes are vectorized and multithreaded
 *  to reduce the time and energy cost of the function.
 *
 *  Please use vImageConverter_MustOperateOutOfPlace() to determine whether a particular conversion can operate in place.
 *  For an in-place conversion to work, it is required that srcs[i].data = dests[i].data and srcs[i].rowBytes = dests[i].rowBytes.
 *
 *  All scanlines must start at an at least byte aligned address. (Some formats have 1, 2, 4 or 12 bits per channel/pixel and
 *  conceivably might not start at a byte aligned address.) A single byte may not span multiple rows of data. 
 *
 *  Some formats, particarly YUV 422 and 420 and those that have pixel size not evenly divisble by 8 bits, operate in chunks 
 *  containing multiple pixels. For example, a Y'CbCr 422 chunk may have {Y0, Cb, Y1, Cr} in the chunk. The chunk contains two
 *  pixels, each with an independent Y (luminance) component, but shared chrominance.  Even though the chunk width is two, 
 *  it is still possible for an image to have a width that is not divisible by two. This means that some part of the chunk on
 *  the rightmost edge of the scanline must refer to a non-existant pixel. When reading incomplete chunks, vImage will only
 *  touch the unused parts of the chunk when it knows it to be safe to do so. When writing incomplete chunks, vImage will 
 *  copy the rightmost valid pixel color into the unused part of the chunk. Thus, on reading the entire chunk doesn't have to
 *  be there, but on writing, it does. Conventions on this are varied among chunk using imaging pipelines and this conservative
 *  approach should interoperate with most. However, some care must be exercised when writing to chunk based formats (not to be
 *  confused with chunky formats which merely have several channels interleaved) to make sure that the buffer is large enough
 *  to tolerate the write policy.  If you are tiling chunk based data, care must be taken not to run tile boundaries 
 *  through the middle of a chunk.  Chunks are assumed to be indivisible.

 *                  determined manually using vImageConverter_GetSourceBufferOrder. The destination buffer may
 *                  only alias the srcs buffers only if vImageConverter_MustOperateOutOfPlace() returns 0, and
 *                  only if the respective scanlines of the aliasing buffers start at the same address.
 *
 *  @param tempBuffer   May be NULL. If not NULL, the memory pointed to by tempBuffer will be used as scratch space

/*
 *  General vImage alignment requirements:
 *  ======================================
 *  All scanlines must be at least byte aligned
 *      A single byte of image data may not span multiple rows of the image.  For example, if the image is 1 bit per pixel monochrome, then
 *      8 pixels fit in a byte. If the width of such an image is not divisible by 8, then the potential exists that the first part of a byte might
 *      lie in one image row and the rest of the byte in the next. It would even be possible that one byte could span up to 8 scanlines if the
 *      image width is 1 pixel! These cases are not allowed. Implicit in the design of using a rowBytes instead of a rowBits describe the image
 *      is that each row must be exactly an integral number of bytes. When the width of the image is such that it would not naturally be so, the
 *      caller must pad out the remaining bits on the image row so that the next row starts on a byte boundary. This is done by setting the rowBytes
 *      to be at least (width * bitsPerPixel + 7) / 8 bytes. When planar images are used then this becomes rowBytes = (width * bitsPerComponent + 7) / 8.
 *
 *      In many cases, images that do not pad rows out to an integral number of bytes can still be processed by vImage by setting
 *      width = height * width and height = 1. However, operating on images with a single row may defeat internal multithreading, so performance
 *      may suffer. (Please use kvImageDoNotTile to defeat internal multithreading if that is your goal. That is its purpose.)  Cleverer schemes that
 *      redivide the image into a larger number of byte aligned rows may be devised.
 *
 *  Some image formats must have 2- or 4-byte aligned scanlines and may need to be host endian
 *      Images with components that are 16-bits in size (e.g. 16U and half float images) or pixels which are 16-bits in size and which do not
 *      have channel boundaries at byte boundaries (e.g. RGB565 and ARGB1555, but not GrayscaleAlpha88) must have vImage_Buffer.data 2-byte aligned and
 *      vImage_Buffer.rowBytes a multiple of 2. Likewise, 32-bits per component (e.g. float or a putative ARGB-2-10-10-10 format) must be 4 byte aligned
 *      and rowBytes a multiple of 4. Failure to conform to 2- and 4-byte alignment restrictions may result in undefined behavior -- at minimum poor
 *      performance and on some systems it can cause a program fault.
 *
 *      Except where otherwise explicitly allowed by the vImageConverter_Create function (e.g. vImage_CGImageFormat.bitmapInfo might be kCGBitmapByteOrder16Big
 *      even on little endian systems) these cases must also conform to the native endianness of the host system. For example, floating-point data on an Intel
 *      system is normally expected to be little-endian unless the converter provides a means to say that it is not. Please see the vImageConverter_Create
 *      function that you plan to use for additional restrictions that may apply.
 *
 *  Performance tips:
 *  =================
 *
 *  Alignment
 *  ---------
 *  Performance will typically improve with even greater alignment up to cacheline aligned image rows. vImageBuffer_Init() can be used to get vImage's
 *  estimation of what sort of row padding is generally likely to work best on the current machine for a given image and pixel size. 
 *
 *  Memory reuse
 *  ------------
 *  It can also be quite helpful to reuse vImage_Buffers and operate in-place so as to avoid spending time in zero-fill faults zeroing the contents 
 *  of newly allocated buffers. (These will show up in Instruments traces as time spent in kernel VM activity.) However, caching unused buffers for 
 *  extended periods of time can contribute to degradation of overall system performance in low memory situations so recycling of buffers is usually 
 *  best done when good temporal locality is expected. LibCache may be helpful for avoiding such problems when it is not known with certainty that the 
 *  buffer will be reused immediately.
 *
 *  Tiling and multithreading
 *  -------------------------
 *  Most vImage functions, including vImageConvert_AnyToAny, will automatically split up work across multiple processors (when available) if there is 
 *  enough image data to warrant it. It can take some time to wake up other processors or redirect their attention from their current task to a new one, 
 *  so multithreading is not attempted if it seems likely the current processor can complete the work before the attention of the other cores can be 
 *  redirected to work on the problem. With some exceptions, the work is typically divided at boundaries between image rows. (To be clear, tiles can be 
 *  taller than just one row.) So, for some functions, if you break up the work to one scanline at a time, it will never multithread. Exactly which functions
 *  do that is subject to change. If you want to stop multithreading, please use kvImageDoNotTile.
 *  
 *  The size of the tile chosen by the function varies by function. Some do little computation and so need the lowest possible load/store latencies to 
 *  run at top speed. Others do more work per byte are consequently not so dependent on low memory access latencies, so may work equally well with tiles 
 *  closer to the size of the L2 or L3 caches and so may use larger tiles. Some computationally intense functions may not care if the data is in cache 
 *  at all. Each vImage function will tile its workload as it sees fit without regard to what other vImage functions may have done or plan to do. 
 *
 *  While this scheme generally works well, you can often do much better with a little work especially in cases where multiple vImage functions are called 
 *  back to back for a few reasons: 
 *
 *      First of all, if the image is larger than the caches, then as new pixels are produced, they will cause earlier result pixels from the same image 
 *  to be flushed to more remote levels of the cache or ultimately out to DRAM (or even disk in low memory situations!) to make room for the new results. When 
 *  it is time to call the next vImage function on the result, you may find that even though you just worked on it, part of the image is not in the cache and 
 *  so you have to pay some time to load it back in again when it as needed. This can happen over and over again with each new vImage filter.  A similar 
 *  story may occur for smaller images as data is flushed from level 1 to level 2 to level 3 of the cache to make room for new data. It would be faster if 
 *  you could somehow move on to the next vImage filter while a region of the image is still in the cache before it is evicted to make room for the rest 
 *  of the image. We will get to the how a little later. 
 *
 *      Second, since processor cores are usually assigned by vImage to work on parts of the image on a first-come first-served basis to keep per-call latency
 *  down, it is probably common that different cores will work on different parts of the image in each successive vImage call, even in cases where the tiling 
 *  strategies between two back to back vImage calls are otherwise similar. That is, in the first vImage function call, the top left corner might be done by 
 *  processor 1 and in the next vImage function call by processor 3. The next time you call the same code, it might be processor 2 and processor 5 that do 
 *  the work on that region. Unfortunately, in many current processor architectures, the faster cache levels (level 1 and 2) are often not shared with most 
 *  of the other cores and it can take more time for the other cores to get data from them. It would be faster if you could somehow convince the same core to 
 *  operate on the same region of the image each time, because only then do we have some guarantee that the faster cache levels are doing us any good between 
 *  back to back calls.
 *
 *      Third, just as it may take some time to get all the processors redirected to work on a particular task, you may also lose some time because 
 *  they don't all finish at the same time. Some processors end up waiting for others to finish before the vImage call can return. Here one expects this 
 *  time lost to be a tiny fraction of the overall time for large images, but for medium sized ones it may weigh against overall performance. (Smaller images
 *  may not even bother to multithread in such cases.) When you advance to the next back-to-back vImage call, some of the cores might have gone to sleep or 
 *  moved on to unrelated work waiting for other cores to finish, and now you have to wait for them to get back on task again. You could reduce overall latency
 *  if you could somehow convince the next filter to start on regions that are done without having to wait for all of the regions of the image to be done, 
 *  so that the cores stay busy and don't get distracted. 
 *
 *      Fourth, doing back-to-back-to-back vImage calls probably means having a bunch of intermediate vImage_Buffers hanging around that take up memory.
 *  In cases where the intermediate computation has to be done in some higher precision, like floating-point, some of these can be quite big. It would be
 *  very helpful to somehow make those go away, or at least go on a diet. 
 *
 *  So, how is this collection of problems fixed? Well, first of all, you don't /have/ to fix anything. Even with all of that, it should still work pretty
 *  well. If pretty well is not good enough, then the solution is to manage the threading yourself. Lets say you want to apply 4 vImage filters (A, B, C and 
 *  D) to an image in a back-to-back fashion. First you break up the result image into a bunch of smaller chunks, called tiles. These should be small enough 
 *  to fit conformably in the cache but not so small that we devote too much time doing setup tasks like parameter checking or initializing variables repeatedly. 
 *  (You can figure out the right size later when it all works. Guess for now.) Starting from the result tiles, work backward. For each tile in the output of D, 
 *  figure out which pixels from C are needed as input. This defines the set of tiles produced by C. In cases where the function needs to look at nearby pixels 
 *  to calculate a result pixel (e.g. Convolution or various Morphology filters) then it is possible that the C-produced tiles may overlap a bit. The process is 
 *  then repeated moving backward through B and A until we arrive at the starting image. We can now trace each result tile through a bunch of discrete image 
 *  fragments back up to a region in the original image. Since we know that we have all the input pixels we need to calculate a result tile at each stage, we 
 *  can apply filters A,B,C and D in series to a tile without needing to worry about what is happening in the other tiles. Thus, each tile can be operated on 
 *  by a different thread, and multithreading becomes trivial.
 *
 *  Consider the implications. Since each tile of data is operated on by a single thread and threads usually do not gratuitously hop around from core to core 
 *  (very much) the result from filter A on that tile should usually be in the right L1 or L2 cache when we call filter B to consume the result from A for that region,
 *  provided that we call filter B on that tile from that thread right away and don't run off and do other things. The same goes for filters C and D. So, you 
 *  are now probably getting better-than-good-enough temporal cache locality.  Observe also that it is generally not required that the intermediate (A,B or 
 *  C product) tiles be stored in memory that is contiguous with other tiles from the same intermediate image. They can be their own little chunks of memory 
 *  stored somewhere else. Maybe you even put them on the stack -- which probably will avoid most zero fill faults and is quick to allocate. In fact, if the 
 *  output tiles are of the same size, then as the thread finishes one tile, you can just reuse those small intermediate buffers that hold the intermediate 
 *  tiles for the next tile. The intermediate image then never exists as a whole at any given time and so you never have to allocate storage for most of it.  
 *  This gives you better-than-good-enough memory usage. Floating-point is starting to look a lot better! Next, because each tile is not waiting on its fellows, 
 *  you can begin working on filter B as soon as the thread is done with filter A. There is no more waiting for filter A to be done on the entire image before 
 *  B can be started. Threads go idle less. There is probably still bit of time lost to waiting for cores to spin up and some for the last thread to finish on 
 *  exit, but it is amortized over four filters instead of each filter. 
 *
 *  Recall that in standard opertaion, vImage will still be trying to multithread behind your back for all these little tiles. This will cause the threads to 
 *  oversubscribe the number of cores. Work that was supposed to be done by one thread is now split up to many. Threads may hop around from core to core much 
 *  more looking for a place to run, defeating cache locality. You may spend a lot of time waiting for cores to redirect to the next job with lots of little 
 *  jobs. The Instruments system trace looks like a tangled knot of threads playing musical chairs for a limited number of cores. To stop this, pass the 
 *  kvImageDoNotTile flag to make sure vImage is running only on the thread you assign to it.

 *    Data Formats
 *    ------------
 *    Most functions are available in four flavors, one for each of the four standard data formats supported
 *    by vImage. These are:
 *
 *    8 bit planar integer data  -- "Planar8":
 *        The buffer contains a single color channel (e.g. red) as an array of packed unsigned chars.
 *
 *    32 bit planar floating point data -- "PlanarF":
 *        The buffer contains a single color channel (e.g. red) as an array of packed floats.
 *
 *    8 bit ARGB interleaved integer data -- "ARGB8888":
 *        The buffer contains four interleaved color channels in the order alpha, red, green, blue, in a
 *        packed array of unsigned chars. (This is a standard 32 bit ARGB color pixel, with 8 bits per channel).
 *
 *    32 bit ARGB interleaved floating point data -- "ARGBFFFF":
 *        The buffer contains four interleaved color channels in the order alpha, red, green, blue, in a
 *        packed array of floats.
 *
 *    Many functions are also available in Planar and ARGB versions of unsigned and signed 16-bit integer, 16S and
 *    16U respectively.
 *
 *    PERFORMANCE ADVISORY: Performance of the planar versions of these functions will in some cases
 *    be *MUCH* better than their interleaved counterparts. Most operations are done in register with planar
 *    data, even if the starting data format was an interleaved format. By using planar data formats,
 *    you avoid the de-interleave, re-interleave cost in each function call. In addition, where calculation
 *    on the alpha channel is not desired, the computational cost and cache usage for planar formats is
 *    in principle 3/4 the cost of interleaved formats for four channel data. Finally planar data is a natural
 *    form of tiling that works well when used with multiple serial filters. When applying multiple filters to
 *    a image, apply them all to one channel, then repeat the sequence for the next channel and so forth until
 *    all the color channels are calculated. This will help keep key data in the caches and in some cases may
 *    produce profound performance improvements.
 *
 *    The presumed value range for 8 bit color channels is 0 to 255, with 0 being black and 255 being full intensity color.
 *    For floating point data, 0.0f is black and 1.0f is full intensity color. Values outside this range are allowed for
 *    floating point data. Except where noted, FP calculations do not clip values outside the range 0.0f ... 1.0f. In certain
 *    cases (most notably geometry operations that involve resampling and colvolutions), it is possible that input data
 *    that is entirely withing the range 0.0f ... 1.0f will produce results that are slightly outside that range. A separate
 *    floating point clipping function is provided if clipping is required.
 *
 *    Other floating point ranges (e.g. 0.0f ... 255.0f) are likely to also work since most functions in vImage are linear.
 *    However, they are not extensively tested.
 *
 *    vImage_Buffers
 *    --------------
 *    Most vImage functions attempt to fill a destination buffer with pixels drawn from an input buffer using some
 *    transformation. In some cases, the operation would require that pixels outside the area covered by the input
 *    buffer be used to fill the output buffer. The input vImage_Buffer defines the absolute limit of the area of
 *    data that may be read by the function. The function will not stray outside of this area in its attempt to
 *    fill the destination with pixels. How a function copes with edge cases when data is unavailable is dependent
 *    on the function.
 *
 *        typedef struct vImage_Buffer
 *        {
 *            void                *data;		// Pointer to the top left pixel of the buffer.
 *            vImagePixelCount	  height;		// The height (in pixels) of the buffer
 *            vImagePixelCount    width;		// The width (in pixels) of the buffer
 *            size_t              rowBytes;	    // The number of bytes in a pixel row
 *        }vImage_Buffer;
 *
 *    Some functions may operate only on a rectangular subset of pixels in the input buffer. This is useful for tiling
 *    or for when image operations are only desired to be applied to part of an image. The top left corner of the subset
 *    is provided by a X and Y offset into the vImage_Buffer passed as the input buffer. The height and width of the input
 *    region of interest is in many cases given by the height and width of the destination buffer. The geometry operators
 *    use non-rectangular input regions of interest making it difficult to predict which pixels will be used. In this case,
 *    the offsets (if any) are the offsets into the input region of interest for the case where the scale factor is 1.0 and
 *    shear and translate are 0.0f.
 *
 *    Please be aware that many functions, especially those that require kernels or which do resampling, will read
 *    outside the input region of interest. Some extra care with multithreaded code may be required in those cases to make
 *    sure nobody is changing data outside the region of interest that is read by the function while the function is operating.
 *    At no time will a function read outside the vImage_Buffer within which the region of interest resides.
 *
 *    So as to make multithreaded tiled (stripmined) algorithms easy to write, vImage makes two guarantees:
 *
 *        (1) vImage will never write data outside of the destination vImage_Buffer. vImage will not try to cheat this
 *            guarantee by reading data outside the destination buffer and writing it back unmodified.
 *
 *        (2) vImage will never read data outside of the area passed to it as the input vImage_Buffer.
 *
 *    The state of the output vImage_Buffer while a vImage function is working on it is undefined. There may be times when
 *    a pixel in the ROI is neither the starting data or the finished result, but instead the result of some
 *    intermediate calculation. The calculation is complete when the function returns.
 *
 *    Note that although a vImage_Buffer struct may be marked const, this does not mean that the pixel data that
 *    it points to is also const. It is merely an indication that it is safe to reuse the struct between function
 *    calls. Except where noted, the pixel data in the input buffers will not be changed by the function. vImage
 *    does not go to extreme lengths to guarantee this however, so for example you may pass the same buffer as input
 *    and output to a function, in which case the input buffer will be changed.
 *    Caution: except where otherwise documented, most vImage functions do not work correctly in place.
 *
 *    Performance advisory: If the rowBytes of a vImage_Buffer is a integer power of 2, performance may be adversely
 *    affected on some functions. (This is a side effect of how some machines handle address arithmetic
 *    internally. It is not something we can solve in software, except by setting rowBytes differently. ) 
 *    In some cases, it may also be advantageous to pad rowbytes out to 16 bytes. Using vImageBuffer_Init() 
 *    in vImage/vImage_Utilities.h will help sidestep this issue. It will attempt tune rowBytes to benefit the 
 *    current architecture.
 *
 *    It is not required that you do set up your buffers exactly this way, however. To protect your investment in
 *    preexisting data structures, vImage is designed to work with any (natural) data alignment and any rowBytes.
 *    Floats must be 4 byte aligned. RowBytes must of course be greater than or equal to width * bytesPerPixel.
 *    BytesPerPixel values are as follows:
 *
 *        Buffer Data Format	Size
 *        ------------------	----
 *        planar uint8		    sizeof( Pixel_8)		// 1 byte
 *        planar float		    sizeof( Pixel_F )		// 4 bytes
 *        ARGB uint8			sizeof( Pixel_8888)		// 4 bytes
 *        ARGB float			sizeof( Pixel_FFFF )	// 16 bytes
 *
 *
 *
 *    Tiling / Strip Mining and Multithreading
 *    ----------------------------------------
 *    In general, the size of the data segment that you operate on is critical to the performance of vImage. In
 *    many cases, the number of pixels that may be processed per second can be up to an order of magnitude lower
 *    for large buffers than for small ones.  A common method to fix this is to operate on small chunks of the image
 *    at a time. Typically, you would apply all the filters one after another to one chunk, before going on to the next
 *    chunk. In this way, the data is much more likely to be in the caches when you need it. This motif is easily
 *    multithreaded in principle, since different processors can work on different chunks concurrently in many
 *    cases.
 *
 *    All vImage functions are thread safe and may be called reentrantly.
 *
 *    A quick test to do to see if tiling is good for you is to measure the number of pixels that you can process
 *    per second for very large (>4 MB uncompressed) and reasonably small (< 256 kB uncompressed) images. If the
 *    number of pixels you can process per unit time is much improved for smaller images over large ones then tiling
 *    is likely to be helpful.
 *
 *    It is important to whenever possible make sure the tile fits in the caches. In general, the data processed in
 *    a single tile (including input and output buffers) should be less than 256 kB, though in some cases there may
 *    be a performance advantage to even smaller buffers. We have found that for many, 16-32 kB is a better number.
 *    In many cases, you will only see performance improvement if the tile is significantly wider than it is tall,
 *    for example 16 rows tall and 1024 horizontal bytes of pixels wide has been observed to be twice as fast as
 *    64x128. Clearly having a tile wider than the image isn't very helpful.
 *
 *    A convenience method for making a vImage_Buffer that refers to a rectangular sub-region of another vImage_Buffer:
 *
 *      // Calculate a vImage_Buffer descriptor for a sub-rectangle within an image
 *      // This function does not attempt to ensure that the tile fits in the image.
 *      vImage_Buffer   MyMakeTileFromImage( const vImage_Buffer *image,
 *                                           unsigned long startColumn, // x coordinate of top left corner of tile
 *                                           unsigned long startRow,    // y coordinate of top left corner of tile
 *                                           unsigned long tileHeight,  // number of rows in tile
 *                                           unsigned long tileWidth,   // number of columns in tile
 *                                           size_t pixelBytes ){       // number of bytes in pixel
 *          return (vImage_Buffer){
 *              .data = (void*) ((char*) image->data + startColumn * pixelBytes + startRow * image->rowBytes),
 *              .height = tileHeight,
 *              .width = tileWidth,
 *              .rowBytes = image->rowBytes
 *          };
 *      }
 *
 *    CAUTION:  This will cause vImage to believe the edges of the image are at the edges of the tile. Usually that 
 *              doesn't affect the result, but will for convolultions, morphology operations and geometry operations
 *              --  things that take a edge mode flag.  For such routines, the start of the tile is declared using
 *              a srcOffsetToROI_X/Y  and the size of the tile is inferred from the destination image size.
 *
 *    Sometimes you may want to flip an image vertically. In vImage, this can be done cheaply by adjusting the pointer
 *    to point to the last scanline of the image and setting rowBytes negative, for either the source or destination
 *    image:
 *
 *      static inline vImage_Buffer MyFlipVertical( const vImage_Buffer *b ) __attribute__ ((always_inline,nodebug));
 *      static inline vImage_Buffer MyFlipVertical( const vImage_Buffer *b ){
 *          return (vImage_Buffer){ .data = (void*) ( (char*)b->data + b->rowBytes * (b->height-1)),
 *                                  .height = b->height,
 *                                  .width = b->width,
 *                                  .rowBytes = -b->rowBytes };
 *      }
 *
 *    CAUTION:  While vImage will put up with this sort of abuse, other frameworks may not. Make sure the data is
 *              right side up before passing it to anyone else.
 *
 *    Real Time Applications
 *    ----------------------
 *    vImage attempts to avoid doing things that will damage its suitability for use in real time applications.
 *    vImage will in general never take a lock, or do things that might involve taking a lock, such as allocating
 *    memory. Functions that may take a lock will be documented as such.  Some functions take temporary buffers
 *    as arguments. If you do not provide a temporary buffer, they may call malloc.
 *
 *    Unused Flag Bits
 *    ----------------
 *    Many of the bits in the vImage_Flags datatype are currently unused. Apple reserves all bits in the flags field
 *    for their exclusive use. You must set all unused bits to 0 in the flags field. If you do not do this, in the
 *    future some of these bits may become active and your application may start doing unexpected things when image
 *    processing.
 *
 *    Getting Data in and out of vImage
 *    ---------------------------------
 *    Since vImage will simply use your data in place in your objects, interfacing with your existing image pipeline
 *    should be a simple matter of intializing the vImage_Buffer struct fields to correspond to the location and
 *    and shape of your data.  
 * 
 *    When the objects are not yours and are opaque, then getting data in and out of those objects can be a little
 *    more work.  Most image frameworks have a method to import and export raw data. These are often simple to use
 *    but the data is frequently not in the format you wanted. In such cases, please see vImage/vImage_Utilities.h for
 *    vImageConvert_AnyToAny() which can convert nearly any image format to nearly any other one with full colorspace
 *    conversion, if desired, even on iOS. This should help you convert the output of one imaging library into 
 *    something useful for another one.  (It is used by ImageIO.framework for example, to convert the many different 
 *    image buffer formats produced by PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, etc. to formats more favored by CoreGraphics, CoreAnimation 
 *    and CoreImage, for example.)  The conversions are vectorized and multithreaded to minimize time and energy 
 *    consumption.
 *
 *    If the opaque image object comes from CoreGraphics (CGImageRef) or CoreVideo (CVPixelBufferRef), then high level
 *    convenience routines are provided to import and export data from those sources as vImage_Buffers. See
 *    vImage/vImage_Utilities.h and vImage/vImage_CVUtilities.h respectively for these.  Since the conversions go through
 *    the same vImageConvert_AnyToAny core, it is possible to convert all the way from a YUV 420 format out to CMYK for
 *    a printer in a single function call, or anywhere inbetween, if you want. A few formats like 565 and half float not 
 *    usually part of CG are supported as a bonus.

     @typedef   vImage_Error 
     @abstract  An error code returned by a vImage function.
     @discussion    All negative values are errors.
                    Positive return values are likely to be the result of kvImageGetTempBufferSize.
                    Zero indicates no error, or quasi-ambiguously a zero temp buffer size, if that
                    flag was passed. Please see the documentation for the function that returned the
                    error code for additional information about the error.
 
    @constant   kvImageNoError      Success.  If kvImageGetTempBufferSize is set in flags, then
                                    it indicates the temp buffer size is 0 and the function did
                                    nothing else.
    @constant   kvImageRoiLargerThanInputBuffer     The size or positioning of the result buffer 
                                    was such that pixels were needed in the source buffer, were
                                    found to be missing and could not be discovered using an edging
                                    process like kvImageEdgeExtend. Typically, this means that the
                                    source image was smaller than the destination image. 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidKernelSize    The size of a kernel was invalid. Typically, kernels have
                                    have an odd number of rows and columns. The kernel might also have
                                    been too large or of zero dimension. Typically only returned by
                                    convolutions and morphological operations.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidEdgeStyle   The edging style {kvImageBackgroundColorFill, kvImageCopyInPlace, kvImageEdgeExtend, kvImageTruncateKernel}
                                    was invalid. Typically, the edging style is either missing or the edging style 
                                    is not supported by this function.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidOffset_X   Some functions take an integer offset in the horizontal dimension. This indicates
                                    how far from the left edge of the vImage_Buffer we shoud consider the origin to be.
                                    The offset allows real pixel data to be used where an edging method like kvImageEdgeExtend
                                    might otherwise have to be used to generate missing pixels. An X offset is essential to
                                    obtaining correct results for tiled image processing when the tile is not at the left
                                    edge of the (whole) image and the function has a kernel or ResamplingFilter.
                                    Typically, this can happen when the offset is negative or larger than the source vImage_Buffer.width.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidOffset_Y   Some functions take an integer offset in the vertical dimension. This indicates
                                    how far from the top edge of the vImage_Buffer we shoud consider the origin to be.
                                    The offset allows real pixel data to be used where an edging method like kvImageEdgeExtend
                                    might otherwise have to be used to generate missing pixels. A Y offset is essential to
                                    obtaining correct results for tiled image processing when the tile is not at the top
                                    edge of the (whole) image and the function has a kernel or ResamplingFilter.
                                    Typically, this can happen when the offset is negative or larger than the source vImage_Buffer.height.
 
    @constant   kvImageMemoryAllocationError    vImage attempted to allocate memory and the allocator failed, returning NULL.
 
    @constant   kvImageNullPointerArgument      One or more arguments to the function are NULL, which are not allowed to be NULL.
                                    Typically, arguments that are not allowed to be NULL are listed in the VIMAGE_NON_NULL() attribute
                                    that follows the function declaration.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidParameter         A function parameter has an invalid value. This is the fallback error code when there is not
                                    an error code that more precisely describes the invalid parameter value such as kvImageNullPointerArgument,
                                    kvImageInvalidEdgeStyle, kvImageInvalidRowBytes, etc.
 
    @constant   kvImageBufferSizeMismatch       This most often occurs when a set of planar buffers are not the same size.  Most often
                                    this occurs when the destination image is planar and the destination planes are not the same size.
                                    It may also occur in rare cases when chunk sizes mismatch for some high level conversions.
 
    @constant   kvImageUnknownFlagsBit      A bit in the flags field is set, which the function does not understand or currently support.
                                    Please check flags enum availability info to make sure the flag is supported on the target OS revision.
 
    @constant   kvImageInternalError    A serious error occured inside vImage, which prevented vImage from continuing. This error is
                                    probably a problem with vImage itself, and not how it is being used. Please file a bug with a
                                    reproducible test case attached, if possible!
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidRowBytes  The vImage_Buffer.rowBytes field is invalid. In some circumstances, rowBytes of 0 is not supported, 
                                    particularly with destination images or when vImage is asked to initialize a vImage_Buffer and the
                                    rowBytes is too small to hold a row of image data.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidImageFormat  Usually a vImage_CGImageFormat or vImageCVImageFormatRef contains an invalid format. It might be a
                                    NULL pointer, a description which is not allowed according to rules of CG or CV image format encodings.
 
    @constant   kvImageColorSyncIsAbsent    ColorSync.framework is completely missing. Certain operations will not work.
 
    @constant   kvImageOutOfPlaceOperationRequired   The source images and destination images may not alias the same image data. This will
                                    be returned by vImageCGConverter_MustOperateOutOfPlace(). However, there are many functions in vImage
                                    that do not work in place which do not check to see if the buffers overlap. Please inspect the documentation
                                    of each function for notes on in-place usage before using them that way.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidImageObject   An invalid CGImageRef or CVPixelBufferRef was passed to the function.  Typically, the object was NULL.
                                    A non-NULL invalid CGImageRef or CVPixelBufferRef will result in undefined behavior.
 
    @constant   kvImageInvalidCVImageFormat A vImageCVImageFormatRef contains an invalid format. It might be a NULL pointer, or an image format
                                    which is not allowed according to rules of CV image format encodings.
 
    @constant   kvImageUnsupportedConversion    Some lower level conversion APIs only support conversion among a sparse matrix of image formats.

 @typedef   vImage_Flags
 @abstract      vImage_Flags is a 32-bit bitfield of options of general use to vImage functions.
 @discussion    Multiple bits may be set concurrently. kvImageUnknownFlagsBit may be returned by
                a function if a flag bit is set (1) but the function does not know what the flag
                bit means (e.g. your new code on an older version of vImage) or if the flag should
                cause a behavior that is unsupported by the function, for example, kvImageHighQualityResampling
                to a function that does not do image resampling.
 @constant  kvImageNoFlags   Use the default behavior. Internal multithreading is enabled. Debug 
                messages are generally not printed to the console. No edging method is specified. 
                Normal quality resampling methods are used (Lanczos3, probably). Do the function,
                instead of returning a temp buffer size. Allocate memory as needed.
 
 @constant  kvImageLeaveAlphaUnchanged   Some functions that operate on ARGB data in place allow
                you to operate on just the RGB components and leave the alpha channel unmodified.
                These are typically histogram and gamma functions.
 
 @constant  kvImageCopyInPlace  One of four edging modes. This one tells vImage to do nothing for
                destination pixels that need source pixels that are missing. The corresponding source
                pixel is copied to the destination image. This is only used for image filters that take a
                kernel, such as convolutions. It is not allowed for Morphology filters.
 
 @constant kvImageBackgroundColorFill  One of four edging modes. This one tells vImage to use the
                backgroundColor parameter of the function as the color of any missing pixels in
                a source image. Missing pixels occur when a filter needs to read off the edge of
                a source image. 
 
 @constant kvImageEdgeExtend    One of four edging modes.  This one tells vImage to use the nearest
                existing source image pixel when it needs source data but finds it needs a non-existant
                pixel off the edge of the provided source image. 
 
 @constant kvImageDoNotTile     Do not internally subdivide the image for processing on multiple CPUs
                or other compute devices. If this flag is set, the function will run single threaded
                on the current thread. Usually this flag may be expected to cause a significant increase
                in the execution time of a vImage function. However, if you are calling the function
                from a heavily multithreaded context (such as your own tiling engine) and CPU occupancy
                is high, this may lead to small performance improvements due to reduced CPU contention.
 
 @constant kvImageHighQualityResampling  Use a more expensive image resampling method than what is available
                by default. Typically this is Lanczos5. Note that as vImage resampling already leans towards
                quality over performance -- the GPU texture unit is your friend if you just want raw performance
                -- the additional quality from kvImageHighQualityResampling may be difficult to see in some images. 
                It is best suited to background rendering tasks.
 
 @constant kvImageTruncateKernel    One of four edging modes. This one tells vImage to use only the pixels it 
                has and reweight the kernel accordingly. The reweighting process can be expensive.  It can 
                also lead to difficulties if a contiguous sub-rectangle of the kernel sums to zero. In this
                case, the area of the kernel is zero and you have formally asked vImage to do division by zero,
                in which case vImage behavior is undefined.
 
 @constant kvImageGetTempBufferSize  Instead of performing the function requested, return (as a vImage_Error)
                the size of the temp buffer requried by the function for this set of parameters. The image pixels
                are not touched. If the function does not take a temp buffer, then 0 will be returned and the 
                function will do nothing. Some functions may return a 0 sized temp buffer for some sets of parameters 
                an not others. The size of the temporary buffer may change for different parameters, and for
                different OS revisions.
 
 @constant kvImagePrintDiagnosticsToConsole Some of the high level functions in vImage_Utilities.h and 
                vImage_CVUtilities.h have complex failure modes that could prove baffling with just a 
                error code return.  This flag instructions these functions to also print a human readable
                diagnostic message to the Apple System Logger when an error is encountered. The output 
                should be visible in Console.app.
 
 @constant kvImageNoAllocate    Some vImage functions may allocate memory, possibly returning it to you.
                This flag instructs the function to use the memory provided instead. For example, instead of
                overwriting vImage_Buffer.data with a newly allocated pointer to memory, use the memory
                pointed to by vImage_Buffer.data directly. In other cases, it may cause the function to
                assume ownership of a buffer, rather than allocating a copy. You are responsible for making
                sure the buffer that you allocate instead of vImage is large enough to hold the image. Most 
                vImage functions do not allocate memory and assume that vImage_Buffer.data is already allocated, 
                and in the case of source image buffers, contain valid pixel data.
 
 @constant kvImageHDRContent    The pixels described in the input image may contain high dymanic range content.
                HDR pixels may have value outside of [-2,2.0]. This flag is generally only applicable to 
                floating-point images. Most 8- and 16-bit pixels can not represent values outside [0,1] and
                functions that operate on 16Q12 formats are designed to operate over the full range of [-8,8).
                Most floating-point functions in vImage are linear in behavior and so work equally well 
                on any float.  Some non-linear functions like polynomials (or by extension colorspace conversion)
                are only valid over a limited range (typically [-2,2]) and will return incorrect answers 
                for values outside that range.  In addition, certain IIR or FFT algorithms in convolution may
                encounter precision issues with HDR content.  For these cases, if you know you have HDR content,
                pass kvImageHDRContent and a (typically slower) alternative method will be used for these
                sources.

    @class vImageConverterRef
    @abstract   An opaque type which contains a decription of a conversion from one CoreGraphics image format to another.
 
    @discussion The vImageConverter is an opaque type which contains information needed to do a rapid conversion from
    one image type to another. Sometimes, it can take a significant amount of time to figure out how to convert
    from one format to another. It wouldn't be good to do that redundantly for a bunch of small images. The
    vImageConversionSetup allows us to set up the conversion once and reuse the information many times, to
    keep net latencies low.
 
    Note that creating a vImageConverter can at times take a while. While usually it is quick, it might have
    to do things like load other frameworks in the system (e.g. Colorsync) if they are not loaded already,
    or build a lookup table. It is a good idea to setup your conversions in advance and reuse the conversion
    objects.  The objects are thread safe. You can use the same object in multiple threads concurrently. They
    follow standard retain / release semantics and can be used as CFTypeRefs.

    @class vImageCVImageFormatRef
    @abstract   An opaque type which contains a decription of a conversion from a CoreGraphics image format to a CVPixelBuffer, or the reverse.
 
    @superclass CFTypeRef
    @discussion The vImageCVImageFormatRef describes how the image is encoded in a CVPixelBufferRef. vImage uses this information to construct converters that
    are capable of converting to and from this image encoding.  The format stores a description of the pixels in the image (planar/color representation/
    bit depth/number of channels, etc.) but not the image size, location of the base pointer or rowbytes. It is intended for the vImageCVImageFormatRef
    to be reused for other CVPixelBufferRefs of the same format, such as other frames from the same movie.
 
    vImageCVImageFormatRefs are capable of holding an incomplete encoding representation. You may be required to provide addition information such
    as colorspace and (YCbCr only) chroma siting or conversion matrix before the vImageCVImageFormatRef can be used for image conversion to other
    formats.
 
    The vImageCVImageFormatRef is a CFTypeRef. CFEqual does not test for equivalence of the userData field. You should use vImageCVImageFormat_Retain/Release
    when working with vImageCVImageFormatRef to manage ownership of the object.

        Thread Safety:

            The vImageCVImageFormatRef may be safely read from multiple threads concurrently.  However,
            it makes no attempt to keep its internal state coherent when multiple threads write to it,
            or when one thread writes to it while one or more threads are reading from it at the same
            time. This can be trivially handled by keeping the knowledge of the vImageCVImageFormatRef
            limited to a single thread while it is being created / configured and then treat it as
            immutable thereafter.  If necessary, you can also use a read/write lock to limit reentrant
            access.

    imageFormatType     A CVPixelFormatType such as '2vuy'. See CVPixelBuffer.h for the complete list.
 
    number_of_channels  How many  color + alpha channels are encoded in the image. An alpha channel is included in this count
                        if it takes up space in the image, even if its value is described always 1.0, for example by /Last
                        kCGImageAlphaNoneSkipFirst or kCVImageBufferAlphaChannelIsOpaque.  This field is automatically initialized
                        based on the imageFormatType (see above) and is never missing.
 
    channel_names       A list of vImageBufferTypeCodes corresponding to the channels in the image. Unlike what happens for
                        vImageConverterRefs, the type codes used here always encode a single color channel.  vImageConverterRefs
                        use the channel names to encode what is in each vImage_Buffer. Here it is used to describe each channel.
                        So, an ARGB buffer might be described as kvImageBufferTypeCode_CGFormat but will be described as
                        { kvImageBufferTypeCode_RGB_Red, kvImageBufferTypeCode_RGB_Green, kvImageBufferTypeCode_RGB_Blue,
                        kvImageBufferTypeCode_Alpha, kvImageBufferTypeCode_EndOfList }. The order of the channels in the list
                        may not match the order of the channels in the buffer.  This field is automatically initialized based on
                        the imageFormatType (see above) and is never missing.
 
   matrix               (YpCbCr only.)  A YpCbCr image has an associated 3x3 matrix that encodes how it was converted to YpCbCr from
                        a reference RGB colorspace (see colorspace below). The matrix is encoded as a NULL pointer when missing.
                        This field is ignored for non-YpCbCr formats.
 
 
   chroma_siting        Some YpCbCr formats store their chroma components as a smaller image than the luminance component.
                        This describes where the subsampled chroma samples are positioned relative to the luminance component.
                        This field is encoded as a NULL CFStringRef when missing. The field is ignored for RGB, monochrome,
                        indexed and 4:4:4 YpCbCr image formats.
 
   colorspace           For RGB, indexed and grayscale images, this is the colorspace that describes the image encoding.
                        For YpCbCr images, this is the colorspace of the RGB image that you get once the matrix (see above)
                        is unapplied. Thus, the colorspace encodes for the underlying primaries and transfer function of the
                        YpCbCr image. See also vImageCreateRGBColorSpaceWithPrimariesAndTransferFunction.  This field is required
                        for all image formats. A colorspace of NULL indicates a missing colorspace. (This is inconsistent with
                        the shorthand used in vImage_Utilities.h where NULL maps to sRGB.)  Since vImage has no concept of
                        a current graphics device, deviceRGB maps to sRGB and device gray maps to gray 2.2. If you wish to
                        ensure no color correction / conversion, you should match this colorspace with the one in the
                        vImage_CGImageFormat to / from which you are converting.
 
   channel_description  Some CVPixelBuffer formats do not use the entire representable range of the format to encode image data.
                        For example, a 'yuvs' "video range" buffer only uses the range [16,235] for luminance and [16,240] for
                        chroma. Values outside that range are considered to have value equal to the nearest in-range value. In
                        addition, we add additionional fields to leave open the possibility that some formats can encode information
                        outside of the traditional [0,1.0] range ([-1.0,1.0] for chroma) so reference values for the encoding for 0
                        and 1.0 are also described. (See vImageChannelDescription below.) The zero/one fields are analogous in function
                        to the decode arrays provided by CG. It is possible to use the channel description to create formats that are
                        not correctly understood by CoreVideo. These are provided to allow for interoperation with custom video formats.
                        The channel description is initialized automatically for known image format types (see imageFormatType above)
                        and probably only very rarely needs to be changed. It is never missing.
 
  alpha_is_one_hint     Some images are encoded with an alpha channel. However, you may have additional information that the image is
                        really completely opaque. The "alpha is one hint" tells vImage that the alpha channel is always 1.0 (opaque)
                        across the entire image. Setting the hint to 1 may allow vImage to avoid work and run faster in some cases.
                        There is no vImageCVImageFormatRef representation for premultiplied alpha, currently. Since it is a hint,
                        the hint may never be missing from a vImageCVImageFormatRef.  The hint is ignored for image formats that do
                        not contain an alpha channel.
 
  user_data             The vImageCVImageFormatRef has a userData field to allow you to easily reference your data starting from
                        a handle to the object. vImage does  not attempt to interact with the memory pointed to by the userData
                        pointer. It simply holds on to the pointer for you and will call a destructor callback function when the
                        vImageCVImageFormatRef to allow you to free that memory, and do any other post processing needed when the
                        vImageCVImageFormatRef is destroyed. Since there is only one userData pointer, by convention its use is
                        considered private to the application/library/framework that created the vImageCVImageFormatRef, including
                        cases where the creator does not set the userData field. If you need to attach your own data to a
                        vImageCVImageFormatRef created by someone else, you can make  a copy of it or wrap it with your own object.

 @/textblock
 
 {R_Yp, G_Yp, B_Yp} are typically derived from the perceived brightness for red, green and blue.
 k0 and k1 are typically scaled so that Cb and Cr have the indicated range. Because of these

 @abstract  Range and clamping information for Y'CbCr pixel formats
 @discussion Y'CbCr formats frequently don't use the entire representable range available to 
             them to represent image data. While a "full range" video format does use the
             entire range, a "video range" format often leaves the extrema unused, except perhaps
             to represent values outside of the standard Y'=[0,1] CbCr = [-0.5, 0.5] range. 
             For example, a 8-bit video range format typically uses the range [16,235] for
             Y' and [16, 240] for Cb and Cr. 
 
 
             Some examples:
    
 @textblock
                (vImage_YpCbCrPixelRange){ 16, 128, 235, 240, 255, 0, 255, 1 }      // video range 8-bit, unclamped
                (vImage_YpCbCrPixelRange){ 16, 128, 235, 240, 235, 16, 240, 16 }    // video range 8-bit, clamped to video range
                (vImage_YpCbCrPixelRange){ 0, 128, 255, 255, 255, 1, 255, 0 }       // full range 8-bit, clamped to full range
 @/textblock
 
            The bias will be the prebias for YUV -> RGB and postbias for RGB -> YUV.
 
 @field Yp_bias The encoding for Y' = 0.0 for this video format (varies by bitdepth)
 @field CbCr_bias The encoding for {Cb,Cr} = 0.0 for this video format. This is usually the MIDDLE of the range of CbCr, not the low end. 
 @field YpRangeMax The encoding for Y' = 1.0 for this video format. For video range, this is typically less than the maximum representable value.
 @field CbCrRangeMax The encoding for {Cb,Cr} = 0.5 for this video format. This is usually near the high end of the encodable range (e.g. 0xf0), if not the maximum encodable value (e.g. 0xff)
 @field YpMax  The encoding for the maximum allowed Y' value. All values larger than this will be clamped to this value.
 @field YpMin   The encoding of the minimum allowed Y' value. All values less than this will be clamped to this value.
 @field CbCrMax The encoding of the maximum allowed {Cb, Cr} value. All chroma values greater than this value will be clamped to this value.
 @field CbCrMin The encoding of the minimum allowed {Cb, Cr} value. All chroma values less than this value will be clamped to this value.

 *                and color twisting.  There are a series of gamma functions that apply a power function
 *                to an image. The power operation is C2 symmetric around the origin such that negative values
 *                are not NaN (unlike pow(-x, y)), but instead -pow(|x|, y) for negative x). 
 *                In addition a series of polynomial and rational evaluators are available. Many complex
 *                functions can be approximated as a polynomial or rational and evaluated more 
 *                cheaply that way. Finally there are single and multi-dimensional interpolated lookup

 *
 * divisor			Divisor to normalize the destination planes.	
 *
 * Operands:
 * ---------
 * srcs				A pointer to an array of vImage_Buffer pointers that
 *					reference the source planes. This array must contain
 *					src_planes number of vImage_Buffer pointers.
 *
 * dests			A pointer to an array of vImage_Buffer pointers that 
 *					reference where to write the destination planes. Only 
 *					the image data pointed to by each vImage_Buffer is modified
 *					(i.e. dests[0]->data), everything else remains unchanged.
 *					This array must contain dest_planes number of vImage_Buffer
 *					pointers.
 *
 * src_planes		The number of source planes.  Must be less than 256.
 *
 * dest_planes		The number of destination planes.  Must be less than 256.
 *                         
 * matrix			The row major transformation matrix with dest_planes number 
 *					of columns and src_planes number of rows.  Be aware that if
 *					any column of this matrix sums to a value larger than 
 *					+-65538 this function may silently overflow.
 *
 * divisor			Division by this value occurs as the last step, in effect
 *					normalizing the output planes.
 *
 * pre_bias			An optional array of length src_planes consisting of int16_t
 *					values. Each value will be added to the corresponding
 *					source plane in srcs.  Pass NULL for no pre_bias.
 *
 * post_bias		An optional array of length dest_planes consisting of 
 *					int16_t values.  Each value will be added to the 
 *					corresponding destination planes in dests.  The post_bias
 *					is added before any clipping, rounding or division.  Pass 
 *					NULL the correct value for for normal rounding (divisor/2).
 *
 * flags			The following flags are allowed:
 *
 *		kvImageDoNotTile			Turns off internal multithreading. You may
 * 									wish to do this if you have your own
 *									multithreading scheme to avoid having the
 *									two interfere with one another.
 *
 * Return Value:
 * -------------
 * kvImageInvalidKernelSize			Either src_planes or dest_planes is 0.
 * kvImageBufferSizeMismatch		All buffers in dests must have the same
 *									width and height.
 * kvImageROILargerThanSourceBuffer The destination buffer size (width, or
 *									height) is larger than the source buffer.
 * kvImageUnknownFlagsBit			Unexpected flag was passed.		
 * kvImageNoError					Success!
 *
 *
 * Comments:
 * ---------
 * Be aware that 32-bit signed accumulators are used in this operation with no
 * overflow protection. To avoid the possibility of overflow, limit the sum
 * of any column in the transformation matrix to values less than +-65536.
 * 
 * The 32-bit accumulated results out of 16-bit range (+-32767) will be subject  
 * clipping before writing to the destination buffer.
 *
 * This routine will work in place provided all of the following are true:
 * src.data == dest.data
 * src.rowBytes == dest.rowBytes
 * kvImageDoNotTile is passed
 *
 *  Some matrix based color transforms, such as that obtained using kColorSyncConversionMatrix are defined differently.
 *
 *      ColorSync:      p' = M1 * p                  M1 = colorsync matrix,  p = input pixel as column vector, p' = output pixel as column vector
 *         vImage:      p'T = pT * M2                M2 = vImage matrix,T indicates transpose -- vImage pixels are row vectors
 *
 *  Given that (A*B)T = BT*AT, it can be shown that M2 = M1T. So, to use the alternative definition here, you need to transpose the matrix.
 *
 * Example:
 * --------
 * To convert RGB to YUV, one might use the following formula:
 *
 *          Y = ( (  66 * R + 129 * G +  25 * B + 128) >> 8) +  16
 *          U = ( ( -38 * R -  74 * G + 112 * B + 128) >> 8) + 128
 *          V = ( ( 112 * R -  94 * G -  18 * B + 128) >> 8) + 128
 *
 *      This translates to a matrix that looks like this:
 *
 *               66     -38     112
 *              129     -74     -94
 *               25     112     -18
 *
 *		Pass 256 as the divisor to handle the >> 8 operation.  The post_bias
 *		argument can handle the addition of { 16, 128, 128 }, however because
 *		this function performs the division last, this array must be scaled by
 *		the divisor, yielding a post_bias of:
 *			post_bias = { 16*divisor + divisor/2, 128*divisor + divisor/2, 
 *									128*divisor + divisor/2}
 *			post bias = { 4224, 32896, 32896 }

 * vImageMatrixMultiply_*
 *
 *	Multiply the M channels in the src buffers (A,R,G...) by a NxM matrix (a##) to yield N channels in the dest buffer(s)
 *	For ARGB interleaved functions, both M and N must be 4. The pre_bias (ca, cr, cg...) is added to the M input channels
 *	before the matrix is applied. The post_bias (ka, kr, kg...)  is added afterward. 
 *
 *                                                             { a00  a10  a20  ... }
 *		{ A', R', G' ...} = { A + ca, R + cr, G + cg, ... } *  { a01  a11  a21  ... } + { ka, kr, kg, ....}
 *                                                             { a02  a12  a22  ... }
 *                                                             { ...  ...  ...  ... }
 *
 *		A', R', G', ... = result channels stored into dests
 *		A, R, G, ... = input channels from srcs
 *		ca, cr, cg, ... = pre_bias elements corresponding to the input src channels, or zero if pre_bias is NULL
 *		a00, a11, a12, ... = elmenets from the matrix[]
 *		ka, kr, kg, ... = post_bias elements corresponding to the destination dest channels, or zero if post_bias is NULL
 *
 *  For integer code, there is an additional division operation that happens at the end, in effect normalizing integer matrices. 
 *  The post-bias is added before any clipping, rounding or division. If you pass NULL for the post-bias, the correct value for 
 *  normal rounding will be used:
 *
 *      integer:            divisor/2
 *      floating point:     0.0f 
 *
 *  Be aware that 32 bit signed accumulators are used for integer code. If the sum over any matrix column is larger 
 *  than +- 2**23, then overflow may occur. Generally speaking this will not happen because the matrix elements are 
 *  16 bit integers, so one would need more than 256 source buffers before it is possible to encounter trouble.
 *
 *  As an example, to convert RGB to YUV, one might use the following formula:
 *
 *          Y = ( (  66 * R + 129 * G +  25 * B + 128) >> 8) +  16
 *          U = ( ( -38 * R -  74 * G + 112 * B + 128) >> 8) + 128
 *          V = ( ( 112 * R -  94 * G -  18 * B + 128) >> 8) + 128
 *
 *  This translates to a matrix that looks like this:
 *
 *               66     -38     112
 *              129     -74     -94
 *               25     112     -18
 *
 *  There is also the >>8 operation and the extra terms to be dealt with. For integer data, you would use a divisor of 
 *  256 to account for the >>8 operation. The divisor is applied last after all other multiplications and additions. 
 *  (For floating point, there is no divisor. Just divide the whole matrix by the divisor if one is needed.) Use the
 *  post bias to handle the +128 and {+16, +128, +128} terms. Since the second set happen after the divisor in the 
 *  formula above, but our post_bias is applied before the divide, you'll need to multiply those biases by the divisor.  
 *  This will give a post_bias of:
 *
 *              {  16 * 256 + 128, 128 * 256 + 128, 128 * 256 + 128 } = { 4224, 32896, 32896 }
 *
 *  Finally, if there is an alpha component, such that you wish to convert ARGB to AYUV, leaving the alpha component
 *  unchanged then add another row and column:
 *
 *      matrix =    divisor      0       0       0
 *                      0        66     -38     112 
 *                      0       129     -74     -94 
 *                      0        25     112     -18 
 *
 *      post_bias =     { divisor/2, 4224, 32896, 32896 }
 *      divisor =       256
 *
 *  Integer results out of range of 0...255 will be subject to saturated clipping before writing to the destination buffer.
 *
 *
 *	Programming Note:
 *		The pre-bias is provided as a convenience. The pre-bias can be converted to a post bias by 
 *	multiplying it by the matrix, which is what we do behind the scenes. Pass NULL for the pre-bias if
 *	you don't want a prebias added in.
 *	
 *	These functions work in place as long as overlapping buffers overlap exactly. Buffers that partially overlap
 *	will yield undefined results. Destination buffers will be stored to in the order they appear in the dests array.
 *	The buffers all need to be the same size. They can have different rowBytes. 	
 *
 *  In cases where the number of src and dest buffers match, these functions will work in place. 
 *  The source and destination buffers may all be different sizes and have different sized rowbytes. The source buffers must 
 *  be at least as large as the dest buffers. In cases where the source buffer is larger than a dest buffer, the portion of the 
 *  source buffer that overlaps the destination buffer when their top left corners are aligned will be used.  
 *
 *  Some matrix based color transforms, such as that obtained using kColorSyncConversionMatrix are defined differently.
 *
 *      ColorSync:      p' = M1 * p                  M1 = colorsync matrix,  p = input pixel as column vector, p' = output pixel as column vector
 *         vImage:      p'T = pT * M2                M2 = vImage matrix, T indicates transpose -- vImage pixels are row vectors
 *
 *  Given that (A*B)T = BT*AT, we find that M2 = M1T. So, to use the alternatively defined matrix here, you need to transpose the matrix 
 *  before passing it to vImage.

/*
 * The gamma calculation is at the simplest level:
 *
 *      if( value < 0) 
 *          sign = -1.0f;
 *      else
 *          sign = 1.0f;
 *
 *      result = pow( fabs( value ), gamma ) * sign;
 *
 *  i.e. negative values are treated as if they are positive, and the sign restored at the end.
 *
 * This provides for symmetric gamma curves about 0, and also solves the problem of NaN results from
 * pow( negative number, non-integer). 
 *
 * The results are available in two varieties, full and half precision. The full precision version covers
 * all pixel values and all exponents and delivers a result within a few ULPs of the IEEE-754 correct powf().
 *       
 * The half precision variant provides a precision of 1/4096: 
 *
 *          fabs((correct result - result provided)) < 1/4096
 *
 * Half-precision is intended to be used with data that will ultimately be converted to 8-bit integer data. 
 * As such, the faster half precision variants only work for floating point pixel values in the range 0.0 ... 1.0.
 * Out of range pixel values will clamp appropriately to 0.0 or 1.0 before the calculation is performed. 
 *
 * In addition, there are restrictions on range on the exponent. In general, for best performance, it should be near 1.0,
 * though a faster path exists out to +-12. If the exponent is outside the prescribed range the code will return a full 
 * precision gamma instead. (In MacOS X.4.3 and earlier, all exponents fall back on the full precision version. )  
 *
 * Half precision calculations that conform to these restrictions are likely to be much faster 
 * than the full precision gamma. Use kvImageGamma_UseGammaValue and kvImageGamma_UseGammaValue_half_precision 
 * to control whether you get a full or half precision result. kvImageGamma_UseGammaValue will never use a 
 * half-precision calculation.
 *
 * There are some additional gamma types for specific gamma curves. These are precise to 1/4096, share the same
 * restrictions as above for the half precision gamma, but execute in less time. (These fixed exponent gamma curves
 * are present in MacOS X.4, unless otherwise noted below.)
 *
 * vImageGamma_PlanarF and vImageGamma_PlanarFToPlanar8 will work in place, provided that the following are true:
 *      src->data == dest->data
 *      src->rowBytes >= dest->rowBytes
 *      if( src->rowBytes > dest->rowBytes ) kvImageDoNotTile must be passed in the flags parameter
 *
 * vImageGamma_Planar8ToPlanarF will NOT work in place. 
 *
 *  For the func
 *
 * These functions will also work for multichannel data, such as RGBAFFFF buffers by adjusting the width of the buffer to 
 * reflect the additional channels. Note that this will cause the alpha channel if there is one to become gamma corrected.

 *
 * The piecewise gamma calculation combines a linear and an exponential (gamma)
 * curve on two regions of the input interval, separated by a user-supplied
 * boundary value.  When the input is greater or equal to the boundary value,
 * the gamma curve is used to generate the output. Otherwise, the linear curve
 * is used.
 *
 * The operation can be described as follows:
 *
 *  For each source pixel value x:
 *    sign = x < 0 ? -1 : 1
 *    absx = x < 0 ? -x : x
 *    if absx < cutoff:
 *      output pixel value = sign * (linearCoeffs[0]*absx + linearCoeffs[1])
 *    else:
 *      y = exponentialCoeffs[0]*absx + exponentialCoeffs[1]
 *      output pixel value = sign * (pow(y, gamma) + exponentialCoeffs[2])
 *
 * If y is negative, the result is undefined.
 *
 * If the source format is Planar8, we multiply by 1/255.0 to get the "input"
 * value used in the expression above; if the destination format is Planar8,
 * we clamp the output value to [0, 1.0], multiply by 255.0 and round to
 * nearest to get the value stored to the destination buffer.
 *
 * If the source format is Planar16Q12, we multiply by 1/4096.0 to get the
 * input value; we clamp to [-8, 8), multiply by 4096.0, and round to nearest
 * to get the stored to the destination buffer.
 *
 * Regardless of the input or output pixel type, the parameters describing the
 * piecewise gamma function are 32-bit floats, with the single exception of the
 * boundary parameter.
 *
 *  Operands:
 *  ---------
 *      src                 A pointer to a vImage_Buffer that references the source pixels
 *
 *      dest                A pointer to a vImage_Buffer that references the destination pixels
 *
 *      exponentialCoeffs   An array of three floating point coefficients for the gamma curve
 *
 *      gamma               The exponent of a power function for calculating gamma correction
 *
 *      linearCoeffs        An array of two floating point coefficients for the linear curve
 *
 *      boundary            The boundary value for switching from linear to gamma curve
 *
 *      flags               The following flags are allowed:
 *
 *          kvImageDoNotTile            Turns off internal multithreading. You may
 *                                      wish to do this if you have your own
 *                                      multithreading scheme to avoid having the
 *                                      two interfere with one another.
 *
 *          kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Does no work and returns zero.
 *
 *  Return Value:
 *  -------------
 *      kvImageNoError                  Success!
 *      kvImageNullPointerArgument      src, dest, exponentialCoeffs, or linearCoeffs pointer is NULL.
 *      kvImageBufferSizeMismatch       The destination buffer size (width or
 *                                      height) is larger than the source buffer.
 *      kvImageUnknownFlagsBit          An unknown or invalid flag was passed. See flags above.
 *
 *  The variants of this routine that have source and dest pixel types of the
 *  same size (Planar8, Planar16Q12, and PlanarF) operate in place so long as
 *  the source and dest image scanlines overlap exactly.  The other variants
 *  (Planar8toPlanar16Q12, Planar8toPlanarF, etc) do not support in-place
 *  operation.

/*
 *  vImagePiecewisePolynomial*
 *
 *  Apply one or more polynomials to the input image to give the output image.  
 *
 *  vImagePiecewisePolynomial_Planar8toPlanarF uses 8 bit data on input and produces floating point data.
 *  vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarFtoPlanar8 uses floating point data on input and produces 8-bit data with saturated clamping at 0 and 255 to prevent modulo overflow.
 *  vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarF floating point data on both input and output.
 *  vImageTableLookUp_Planar8 uses 8 bit data and produces 8 bit data. In certain cases, the matrix multiply function may also be appropriate.
 *
 *  No other arithmetic is done. If you wish a /255 or *255 operation to be done as part of the calculation, you must incorporate that into your polynomial.
 *
 *  The arrangement of the polynomials is defined as follows:
 *      Let there be N polynomials that each cover part of the single precision floating point range that are arranged in order of area of influence from -Infinity to Infinity.
 *      The ith polynomial shall operate on the set of input pixel values that fall in the range:  
 *
 *          boundary[i] <= pixel_value < boundary[i+1]. 
 *
 *     for which:
 *
 *          boundary[0] = smallest value fit by the polynomial. Input pixels smaller than this will be clamped to this value before the calculation is done. Use -Inf for no lower limit.
 *          boundary[N] = largest value fit by the polynomial. Input pixels larger than this will be clamped to this value before the calculation is done. Use +Inf for no upper limit.
 *          boundary[1....N-1] = the boundaries separating the input ranges covered by the various polynomials provided (see below)
 *
 *     NaNs will return NaNs. The last polynomial also operates on Inf.  N must be an integer power of 2.
 *     Values found in the destination array are undefined until after the function returns.
 *	   The behavior is undefined if boundaries are NaN.
 *
 *  These functions will also work for multichannel data, such as RGBAFFFF buffers by adjusting the width of the buffer to 
 *  reflect the additional channels. Note that this will cause the alpha channel, if there is one, to become modified like the other channels.
 *  These will work in place, provided that the following are true:
 *      src->data == dest->data
 *      src->rowBytes >= dest->rowBytes
 *      if( src->rowBytes > dest->rowBytes ) kvImageDoNotTile must be passed in the flags parameter

 *
 *  The input parameters are as follows:
 *
 *      src = a pointer to a vImage_Buffer containing the input data for the function
 *      dest = a pointer to a vImage_Buffer structure that describes where to write the results
 *
 *      coefficients = a packed array of pointers to packed arrays of (order+1) polynomial coefficients ( i.e. coefficients[ N ][ order + 1 ] ). 
 *                      The polynomials must appear in order from least to greatest sorted by area of influence.
 *                      The polynomials must all be of the same order. 
 *                      The polynomial coefficients are sorted from 0th order term to highest order term 
 *
 *      boundaries = a packed array of (N+1) floating point values that mark the dividing line between one polynomial and the next. These must be sorted from most negative to most positive. 
 *						Input pixel values less than boundaries[0] will be clamped to be equal to boundaries[0] before the calculation is done
 *						Input pixel values greater than boundaries[N] will be clamped to be equal to boundaries[N] before the calculation is done
 *
 *      order = the number of coefficients minus one used for each polynomial -- all the polynomials must be of the same order
 *                  A polynomial with _two_ coefficients (y = c0 + c1 * x) is a _first_ order polynomial. Pass 1 for a first order polynomial. Pass 2 for a second order polynomial, etc. 
 *
 *      log2segments = log2(N)  
 *
 *      flags = no flags are currently honored. You must pass zero here.
 *
 *      vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarF will work in place.
 *      vImagePiecewisePolynomial_Planar8toPlanarF will work in place.
 *      vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarFtoPlanar8 will NOT work in place.
 *
 *  Performance advisory: 
 *      It costs much more to resolve additional polynomials than to work with higher order polynomials. 
 *      For performance, you are typically better off with one 9th order polynomial that spans the range you are 
 *      interested in than many first order polynomials that cover the area in a piecewise fashion.
 *      Vector code execution time is roughly proportional to:
 *
 *              time = (base cost to touch all the data) + polynomial order + 4 * log2segments
 *
 *      The vector code for an unsplit 13th order polynomial should be about as fast as vImageLookupTable_Planar8toPlanarF() 
 *          on a G4.
 *
 *      With data not in cache, the time may be significantly different. For sufficiently small polynomials, the 
 *      cost may be a fixed cost, dependent only on how much data is touched, and not on polynomial order.
 *
 *        This performance behavior is provided to help developers evaluate speed tradeoffs. It is not a guarantee.
 *        It is subject to change in future operating system revisions, and may be different on different hardware
 *        within the same or different operating system revisions. 
 *
 *      Vector code is not invoked for log2segments > 3.
 *
 *  Accuracy advisory:
 *      Single precision floating point arithmetic is used. While some polynomials may fit a desired curve 
 *      within prescribed error limits when using infinite precision math, limited floating point precision 
 *      may in practice cause significant error to accumulate for some sets of polynomial coefficients. It is 
 *      recommended that you test all reasonable floating point pixel values to make sure that they do indeed
 *      give results that conform to prescribed error limits. 
 *      
 *
 *  Usage Example:
 *  --------------
 *      Lets say you want to mimic the sRGB gamma curve using vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarF. The sRGB gamma curve is defined as follows:
 *
 *              if( {R,G,B} < 0.00304 )
 *                  result = 12.92 * {R,G,B}
 *              else
 *                  result = -0.055 + 1.055 * Pow( {R,G,B}, 2.4 )
 *
 *      Because the power function isn't a polynomial and we need a polynomial, we will approximate it with a second order polynomial:
 *
 *              if( {R,G,B} < 0.00304 )
 *                  result = 12.92 * {R,G,B}
 *              else
 *                  result = c0 + c1 * {R,G,B} + c2 * {R,G,B}^2
 *
 *      (Finding the best values for c0, c1, c2 to approximate -0.055 + 1.055 * Pow( {R,G,B}, 2.4 ) over the range [0.00304, 1.0] is 
 *          left as an exercise for the reader.) 
 *
 *      We have two polynomials -- one for the region below 0.00304 and one for the region above, so N = 2.
 *      The highest order polynomial is a second order polynomial, so order = 2.
 *
 *              const int N = 2;        // two polynomials 
 *              const int order = 2;    // the polynomials are second order (have three terms, including zero terms)
 *
 *      The two polynomials are:
 *
 *              float linearPart[ order + 1 ] = { 0, 12.92, 0 };    // result = 0 + 12.92 * {R,G,B} + 0 * {R,G,B} * {R,G,B}
 *              float nonLinearPart[ order + 1 ] = { c0, c1, c2 };  // result = c0 + c1 * {R,G,B} + c2 * {R,G,B} * {R,G,B}
 *
 *      Here we assemble the rest of the information:
 *      
 *              float *coefficients[ N ] = { linearPart, nonLinearPart };   // sorted in order of area of influence from least to greatest. ( x < 0.00304, x >= 0.00304 )
 *              float boundaries[ N+1 ] = { 0.0f, 0.00304, 1.0f };      // sorted in order from least to greatest. 0.0f and 1.0f define the range over which the polynomials are valid. 0.00304 is the single value separating the two polynomials
 *              int log2segments = 1;   // log2(N)
 *              int flags = 0;          // no flags

 *  This is just like vImagePiecewisePolynomial_<fmt>.  However, when it is applied, a modified polynomial p'(x) is actually used:
 *
 *      p'(x) = p(fabsf(x)) * copysignf( 1.0f, x)

/*
 *      vImagePiecewiseRational_PlanarF is similar to vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarF
 *      Except that it evaluates a piecewise rational expression in the form of:
 *
 *                      c0 + c1*x + c2*x^2 + c3*x^3...
 *          result = -----------------------------------
 *                      d0 + d1*x + d2*x^2 + d3*x^3...
 *
 *      The function is behaves nearly exactly like vImagePiecewisePolynomial_PlanarF, except that
 *      there are now two polynomials, for top and bottom of the divide shown above. Each
 *      polynomial has its own set of coefficients and its own polynomial order. The two 
 *      polynomials share the same set of segment boundaries. If the polynomials are split then 
 *      all the top polynomials must be of the same order, and all the bottom polynomials must 
 *      be of the same order. However, regardless of whether the polynomial is split or not,
 *      the top polynomials do not need to be the same order as the bottom polynomials.
 *
 *      This function does not deliver IEEE-754 correct division. The divide does not round per
 *      the IEEE-754 current rounding mode. It incurs up to 2 ulps of error. Edge cases involving 
 *      denormals, infinities, NaNs and division by zero return undefined results. (They will not 
 *      crash, but NaN is a likely result in such cases.) Denormals can be rescued on AltiVec enabled 
 *      machines by turning off the Non-Java bit in the VSCR, at the expense of taking a many-thousand 
 *      cycle kernel exception every time a denormal number is encountered. Since you can predict ahead 
 *      of time whether a given set of bounded polynomials is going to encounter these conditions, 
 *      this problem should be avoidable by wise choice of polynomials. Developers who require IEEE-754 
 *      correct results should call the polynomial evaluator above twice and do the division themselves. 
 *
 *      These functions will also work for multichannel data, such as RGBAFFFF buffers by adjusting the 
 *      width of the buffer to reflect the additional channels. Note that this will cause the alpha channel, 
 *      if there is one, to become modified like the other channels.
 *
 *      These will work in place, provided that the following are true:
 *          src->data == dest->data
 *          src->rowBytes >= dest->rowBytes
 *          if( src->rowBytes > dest->rowBytes ) kvImageDoNotTile must be passed in the flags parameter

 *      Performance Advisory:
 *        Approximate cost of evaluating a rational (in the same units as polynomial above) is:
 *
 *              time = (base cost to touch all the data) 
 *                          + top polynomial order 
 *                          + bottom polynomial order 
 *                          + 4 
 *                          + 4 * log2segments
 *
 *        With data not in cache, the time may be significantly different. For sufficiently small polynomials, the 
 *        cost may be a fixed cost, dependent only on how much data is touched, and not on polynomial order.
 *
 *        This performance behavior is provided to help developers evaluate speed tradeoffs. It is not a guaranteed. 
 *        It is subject to change in future operating system revisions, and may be different on different hardware
 *        within the same or different operating system revisions.

/*
 *  vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create
 *
 *  Creates a vImage_MultidimensionalTable for use with vImageMultiDimensionalInterpolatedLookupTable_<fmt>(). The
 *  input data is a contiguous array of N dimensional samples which define the lookup table grid points.
 *  The samples have range [0,65535] interpreted as [0, 1.0f]. (Samples have an implict divide by 65535
 *  in them, like the Planar16U format.)  
 *
 *  The vImage_MultidimensionalTable is not a CFType.
 *
 *  Example: 
 *      Suppose the multidimensional table is intended to convert RGB (3 channel) data to CMYK (4 channel).
 *      In each of the {R, G, B} dimensions, we have 17 samples. The table is then comprised of
 *      17x17x17=4913 uint16_t[4]'s, each of which contains {C,M,Y,K} for that position. The dimensions
 *      are iterated in standard C order (row major). In this case, they would be:
 * 
 *      {CMYK for  R0G0B0, CMYK for R0G0B1,  CMYK for  R0G0B2, ...  CMYK for  R0G0B16,
 *       CMYK for  R0G1B0, CMYK for R0G1B1,  CMYK for  R0G1B2, ...  CMYK for  R0G1B16,
 *       ...
 *       CMYK for R0G16B0, CMYK for R0G16B1, CMYK for R0G16B2, ...  CMYK for R0G16B16,
 *       CMYK for  R1G0B0, CMYK for R1G0B1,  CMYK for R1G0B2,  ...  CMYK for R1G0B16,
 *       ...
 *       CMYK for R1G16B0, CMYK for R1G16B1, CMYK for R1G16B2,  ...  CMYK for R1G16B16,
 *       ...
 *       CMYK for R16G16B0, CMYK for R16G16B1, CMYK for R16G16B2,  ...  CMYK for R16G16B16 }
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      tableData                   A non-NULL pointer to the data used to build the table
 *      numSrcChannels              The number of channels in an input pixel
 *      numDestChannels             The number of channels in an output pixel
 *      table_entries_per_dimension An array containing the number of table entries for each dimension in numSrcChannels
 *                                      The entries are in the same order as the channels in the src pixel.
 *      hint                        An indication of how the table would be used.  Pass either kvImageMDTableHint_16Q12
 *                                      or kvImageMDTableHint_Float or both. If only one is passed, we will save memory
 *                                      and time skipping work to set up the table for unused formats.
 *      flags						The following flags are allowed:
 *
 *				kvImageDoNotTile	Turns off internal multithreading. You may
 * 									wish to do this if you have your own
 *									multithreading scheme to avoid having the
 *									two interfere with one another.
 *      err                         A pointer to a vImage_Error. If err != NULL, on return, the memory pointed to by error
 *                                      will be overwritten with an appropriate error or kvImageNoError. It is sufficient to 
 *                                      simply check the LHS return value against NULL to determine whether the function succeeeded.
 *
 *  Return value:
 *      On return a valid vImage_MultidimensionalTable for use with vImageMultiDimensionalInterpolatedLookupTable_<fmt>
 *      if err is not NULL, the memory it points to will be overwritten with an appropriate error code. The 
 *      vImage_MultidimensionalTable will contain a copy of the data provided in tableData. It is safe to deallocate
 *      the input tableData immediately after this call returns.
 *
 *       
 *
 *  Errors:
 *      kvImageNoError                Success
 *      kvImageInvalidParameter       hint must be kvImageMDTableHint_16Q12 or kvImageMDTableHint_Float or both
 *		kvImageInvalidParameter       numSrcChannels and numDestChannels must be non-zero.
 *      kvImageNullPointerArgument    tableData and table_entries_per_dimension must not be NULL.
 *      kvImageUnknownFlagsBit        An illegal or unknown flag was passed to the function.
 *      kvImageMemoryAllocationError  Can not allocate memory for buffer.
 *      
 *  Use vImageMultidimensionalTable_Release to destroy the vImage_MultidimensionalTable when you are done with it. 
 *  The vImage_MultidimensionalTable may be reused. The table is immutable, thread-safe and may be used by many 
 *  vImageMultiDimensionalInterpolatedLookupTable_<fmt> calls concurrently so long as care is taken that it is not 
 *  freed while it is being used. To support multithreaded concurrent access, the table follows standard retain/release 
 *  semantics. On creation the table has a retain count of 1. When the reference count drops to 0, the table is destroyed.

/*
 *  vImageMultiDimensionalLookupTable_PlanarF
 *
 *  vImageMultiDimensionalLookupTable_<fmt> uses the input color channel values (treated as a N-dimensional coordinate)
 *  to index a N-dimensional lookup table to find a new color value, possibly in a new color space. The number of color channels
 *  in the destination image does not need to match the number of color channels in the source image. The table is created using
 *  vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create. 
 *
 *  In each dimension, the table must be of size (2**K[dimension])+1. The first entry corresponds to 0 and the last to 1.0. The rest
 *  correspond to steps at 2**-K[dimension]. (K[] is the table_entries_per_dimension[] array in vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create.)
 *  Thus a 17x17x17 3D lookup table defines the vertices that delineate a grid of 16x16x16 cubes, just as a ruler marked in 16ths of an
 *  inch has 17 marks between 0 and 1 inch, inclusive. (SI units are usually awkwardly subdivided by powers of 10, rather than powers of 2
 *  so we avoid them in this example. :-)    The most significant portion of the color channel values are used to index the multidimensional 
 *  grid. Usually there will be some fractional precision left over.  That is used to do a linear interpolation between nearby gridpoints 
 *  to find the value at that position. If the vImage_InterpolationMethod is kvImageFullInterpolation, then all 2**N (for N dimensions) 
 *  nearby gridpoints are considered. If the vImage_InterpolationMethod is kvImageHalfInterpolation, then the {0,0,0...}, {1,1,1...} verticies 
 *  along the gray axis are considered along with N-1 nearest other vertices. 
 *
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *
 *      srcs                    An array of vImage_Buffers that reference the source image planes. The number of
 *                              such buffers is given by the numSrcChannels parameter passed to vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create.
 *
 *      dests                   An array of vImage_Buffers that reference the destination image planes. The number of
 *                              such buffers is given by the numDestChannels parameter passed to vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create.
 *
 *      tempBuffer              May be NULL. If non-NULL, this is a pointer to a region of memory that vImage can use as a 
 *                              scratch space for storing temporary data. The minimum size of the scratch space is obtained  
 *                              by calling the function with identical parameters and the kvImageGetTempBufferSize flag.
 *                              If vImageMultiDimensionalInterpolatedLookupTable_<fmt> can be called from multiple threads
 *                              simultaneously, the temp buffer must be different (or NULL) for each thread. 
 *
 *      table                   A valid table created by vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create
 *
 *      method                  either kvImageFullInterpolation or kvImageHalfInterpolation. See description above.
 *
 *      flags                   Must be kvImageNoFlags or one or more from this list:
 *                              
 *                                  kvImageDoNotTile            turn off internal multithreading. 
 *                                  kvImageGetTempBufferSize    Return the size of temp buffer. It may return 0. Do nothing.
 *
 *  Error Values:
 *		>= 0                        Minimum temp buffer size, if kvImageGetTempBufferSize was specified.
 *      kvImageNoError              Success
 *      kvImageNullPointerArgument  srcs, dests and table may not be NULL
 *      kvImageUnknownFlagsBit      An illegal or unknown flag was passed to the function.
 *      kvImageInvalidParameter     An unknown or illegal interpolation method was indicated
 *      kvImageInvalidParameter     The interpolation method doesn't have a table for the requested data type. 
 *                                      This happened because an incorrect vImageMDTableUsageHint was passed to
 *                                      vImageMultidimensionalTable_Create
 *      kvImageBufferSizeMismatch   Within srcs, all vImage_Buffers must have the same height and width.

 *
 *	The kvImageLeaveAlphaUnchanged flag is ignored for this set of functions, since most of these

/*
 * High Level Geometry Functions
 * ----------------------------
 * vImage provides a set of high level geometry functions to do simple geometric transforms on an image. 
 * These are:
 *
 *	Rotate -- rotate the input image around a center point by any amount and write to a destination buffer.
 *	Scale  -- resize the input image to the size of the destination buffer
 *	Affine Transform -- Apply an affine transform to an image
 *
 * When calling the Rotate and Affine Transform functions, it is possible that some part of the output 
 * image may come from regions of the input image that are outside the original input image. In these cases,
 * the "revealed" pixels will be of the color provided in the backgroundColor parameter passed to the function,
 * unless kvImageEdgeExtend is passed, in which case it will be taken from the nearest edge pixel. 
 *
 * The Scaling function may need to read outside the edges of the input buffer to service the resampling kernel.
 * In this case the values of the edge pixels a replicated outward infinitely. This allows us to avoid having
 * the background color bleed into the edges of the image. If you wish to rescale part of an image and have the rest
 * of the image considered for this operation, use the Affine Transform for scaling. 
 *
 * Temporary Buffers
 * -----------------
 * The high level geometry functions cannot operate in place and cannot operate simply within the confines of the 
 * source and destination buffers. This is because they employ multipass algorithms that need to save 
 * intermediate pixel values between passes. The destination buffer may not be large enough to hold that
 * information or later passes may not operate correctly in place, meaning that additional storage is 
 * required. Temporary storage is required by the higher level Geometry operations: Rotate, Scale, 
 * and Affine Transform. 
 * 
 * Even though temporary storage is required by these functions, you may pass NULL for the pointer to
 * a temporary buffer. This may cause vImage to call malloc to allocate a buffer for you. It will 
 * be destroyed before the function returns to prevent a memory leak. This is a perfectly sensible thing
 * to do when the function is not called often and possibly blocking on a lock for a short period of time
 * is not a problem. (Malloc may block on a lock.)
 *
 * If you plan to call the function frequently over a relatively short period of time, or you need real time 
 * performance guarantees (which make locks a problem) then you should preallocate your own temporary 
 * working buffer for vImage to use and reuse that. This will avoid the per-call malloc overhead, helping 
 * to guarantee top performance. In addition, it avoids a problem caused by the fact that large 
 * (i.e. image sized) buffers allocated by malloc are usually allocated by the OS in a paged-out state. 
 * (They are not on disk. They do not physically exist until you touch the page, at which point they are 
 * allocated and zero filled on demand.) This means that as we touch each new 4k page we take an interrupt to zero fill 
 * the page, which would be nice to avoid. If you call the vImage function rarely, this is not worth worrying 
 * about, since whatever buffer you preallocate is likely to be paged out to disk by the VM system anyway. 
 * It is just on the 2nd and later calls in quick succession that this is a performance win, since we can 
 * avoid the paging activity.
 *
 * You may allocate the temporary buffer anywhere you like -- heap, global, stack, etc. 
 * Be aware that the stack size limit is user configurable and in many cases may not be large enough.
 * The buffer should not be shared reentrantly between different threads in a multithreaded app, unless you
 * protect it with a mutual exclusion device such as a lock/mutex/etc. Otherwise two vImage functions may
 * overwrite each other and produce garbled image data. No information is kept in the temporary buffer 
 * between function calls. 
 *
 *  All four channel geometry functions (i.e. those that support ARGB8888, ARGB16U, ARGB16S or ARGBFFFF images) work equally 
 *  well on four channel images with other channel orderings such as RGBA or BGRA.

/*
 * vImageRotate_<fmt>
 * =================
 * vImageRotate_<fmt> is a convenience function to provide facile rotation of images about their center point. The operation can also be done with vImageWarp_<fmt>, or 
 * by using appropriate low level vImageHorizontal/VerticalShear_<fmt> interfaces. vImageWarp_<fmt> may be appropriate if you wish to rotate around a non-center point in
 * the image. vImageHorizontal/VerticalShear_<fmt> will provide the greatest detail in control, since it allows for alternative sampling methods, and also the opportunity to
 * control how tiling is done. This might allow for better cache utilization in cases where a format conversion (or other fast filter) is required either before or after
 * the scaling operation and you wish to incorporate it into your tiling design.
 *
 * To avoid artifacts in high frequency regions of the image, the data should be non-premultiplied, or at minimum have the same alpha over the entire image. For integer
 * formats with constant alpha < PIXEL_MAX, it is possible for result color values to be greater than alpha.  vImageClipToAlpha_<fmt> can be used to correct that problem.
 * Some other functions like vImageUnpremultiplyData_<fmt> will correct the problem as part of their operation, if they appear later in your image pipeline.
 * Otherwise, integer formats are clamped in the range [0,255] and can not experience modulo overflow problems. For floating-point formats, it is always possible to
 * produce out-of-gamut or greater than alpha results, most often in high-frequency regions of the image. Out-of-gamut results are often resolved when the floating-point
 * format is converted to an integer format in a later vImage call -- all conversions to integer format are clamped to the representable range. However, color values
 * greater than alpha will persist if the alpha is less than fully opaque, and can be fixed by vImageClipToAlpha_<fmt> as with the integer formats.
 * vImageUnpremultiplyData_<fmt> and vImagePremultiplyData_<fmt> are much, much faster than vImageRotate_<fmt> and typically only add a few percent to the overall cost 
 * of the filter.

 * vImageRotate_<fmt>() does not work in place

 *
 * Acceptable flags are kvImageEdgeExtend, kvImageBackgroundColorFill, kvImageDoNotTile, kvImageHighQualityResampling, kvImageNoFlags. If no edging mode is passed, 
 * the edging mode is undefined. You may not pass both kvImageEdgeExtend and kvImageBackgroundColorFill. kvImageEdgeExtend will leave odd stripes in areas for which  
 * no corresponding source image pixel exists, corresponding to the value of the nearest edge pixel, for some value of "nearest". kvImageBackgroundColorFill is most 
 * commonly used.

 *
 *	The Reflect functions simply reflect images horizontally or vertically. Horizontal reflection inverts the image

/*
 * 	The Rotate90 function does simple 0, 90, 180 or 270 degree rotation according to the value of a rotation constant
 *	passed to it. The images are rotated about their center. If the source and destination sizes do not match, parts 
 *	of the image may be cut off. Other parts may have no image, in which case the background color will be drawn there.
 *
 *	CAUTION: 90 and 270 degree rotation does not rotate about the true center of the image if the height of the source image  
 *	is an odd number of pixels and the width of the destination image an even number of pixels, or vice versa. This is also 
 *	true of the source width and destination height. In this case, you should use the High level rotate function for 90 or 
 *	270 rotates so that the resampling can be done to shift the image a half pixel for proper centering. It may be somewhat 
 *	faster to widen the destination image by 1 and use the low level shearing functions to resample the image at a a half pixel offset.
 *	For 0 and 180 degree rotates, if the source and destination buffers are a different size, the two heights must have matching
 *	even/oddness and the two widths must have matching even/oddness. Otherwise the image will be rotated and shifted a half pixel 
 *	away from the center. 
 *
 *	rotationConstant:	0 -- rotate 0 degrees (simply copy the data from src to dest)
 *				1 -- rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise
 *				2 -- rotate 180 degress
 *				3 -- rotate 270 degrees counterclockwise
 *
 *	backColor:	The color of the background. This color will be copied to any place where pixels are revealed because
 *			the input image does not completely cover the output image. 
 *
 *  Acceptable flags are kvImageDoNotTile, kvImageNoFlags.
 *
 *  These functions do not work in place.
 *
 *  All four channel geometry functions (i.e. those that support ARGB8888, ARGB16U, ARGB16S or ARGBFFFF images) work equally well on 
 *  four channel images with other channel orderings such as RGBA or BGRA.

 *	The shearing functions use a resampling filter for their work. Before you call these functions you must

 *	The scale parameter is the amount to enlarge or reduce the output image. It is the same meaning

 *		{
 *			int i;

 *			}
 *
 *			//Make sure the kernel values sum to 1.0. You can use some other value here. 
 *			//Values other than 1.0 will cause the image to lighten or darken.
 *			sum = 1.0f / sum;
 *			for( i = 0; i < count; i++ )
 *				yArray[i] *= sum;
 *			
 *		}
 *
 *	This specifies the tent line shape centered around 0.0f that defines a linear interpolation kernel. 
 *	The array of values you will be asked to provide are the entire resampling window for a single pixel.
 *	The x values are pixel positions relative to the result, and the y values are where you should put
 *	the kernel values for those positions. The x values will range from -kernelWidth to kernelWidth.
 *
 *	The array format is used for efficiency, and also to give you the opportunity to make sure the kernel 
 *	adds up to 1.0 or some other desired value. Making sure that the kernel values add up to 1.0 will
 *	prevent interference patterns from emerging in the image. Since the sampling kernel function itself is 
 *	sampled during the process of pairing kernel values against sampled pixel data, the sampled kernel data 
 *	does not always integrate to the same value that the parent function does, so usually we must normalize 
 *	it to prevent interference/moiree patterns from to emerging in the image as the pixels in the input buffer 
 *	drift in and out of phase with those in the output buffer. Sums less than 1.0f will cause the image to 
 *	darken. Gain values greater than 1.0 may cause significant clipping for integer pixel data. Kernel values 
 *	are clipped at approximately +- 2.0 for all integer data. If your filter function values exceed +- 2.0, then
 *	you will need to use the floating point data format to avoid overflow. 
 *
 *	If you pass NULL for the kernelFunc, vImage will use its default resampling kernel. You can control 
 *	whether the high quality resampling kernel is used or not by setting the kvImageHighQualityResampling 
 *	bit in the flags field. This allows you to use the default resampling kernel in your own buffer. If you do
 *	not pass NULL for the kernelFunc, the kernelFunc and your userData parameter must be valid for the lifetime
 *	of the ResamplingKernel. 
 *
 *	The kernelWidth parameter controls the limiting values of x, when creating the new kernel. A kernelWidth 
 *	of 1.0 would allow input samples between -1.0 and 1.0 pixels away from the destination pixel to influence 
 *	the result. For Lanczos3, we would use a kernelWidth of 3.0f, because the Lanczos3 function is defined 
 *	over the range -3.0f to 3.0f. If your function is only defined over part of the range -x...x, then have 
 *	your function return zero for the rest of the function. The computational cost of the shearing functions

/*
    The goal of the following preprocessor statements is to define the
    preprocessor symbol _AltiVecPIMLanguageExtensionsAreEnabled if and only if
    the AltiVec high-level language programming interface is enabled.  We
    designed the statements to accommodate some non-Apple compilers but cannot
    assure behavior with non-Apple products.

    Apple GCC version 3.3 and earlier versions defined the preprocessor symbol
    __VEC__ if and only if the AltiVec programming interface were enabled.
    Later versions define __VEC__ when the AltiVec instruction set is enabled
    (and thus available for the compiler's assembly code generation) even if
    the programming interface is not enabled (and thus not available at the
    source code level).  This occurs, for example, when -maltivec is specified
    but neither -faltivec is specified nor <altivec.h> is included.

    Due to this change, code that formerly used __VEC__ to select source code
    with or without use of the AltiVec programming interface should now use
    _AltiVecPIMLanguageExtensionsAreEnabled.

    For more information about the interface, see AltiVec Technology
    Programming Interface Manual (ALTIVECPIM/D 6/1999 Rev. 0, published by
    Motorola Inc. [now Freescale, Inc.]).

*  A few explanations for the choices made in naming, passing arguments, and        *
*  various functions.                                                               *

*      1) Names for the functions are made compatible with the names used in the    *
*      vBasicOps library. The format of the names are the same and include a        *
*      designation to show a vector operation, then a symbol for the type of data   *
*      (signed or unsigned), followed by the size of operands, then the operation   *
*      performed.                                                                   *
*                                                                                   *
*      2) Note that the logical and arithmetic shiftLeft operation are the same.    *
*                                                                                   *
*      3) Rotate operation is performed on unsigned and signed numbers.             *
*                                                                                   *

/*  Documentation conventions:

        Many of the routines below are documented with C-like pseudocode that
        describes what they do.  For example, vDSP_vadd is declared with:

            extern void vDSP_vadd(
                const float *__A,
                vDSP_Stride  __IA,
                const float *__B,
                vDSP_Stride  __IB,
                float       *__C,
                vDSP_Stride  __IC,
                vDSP_Length  __N)
                    __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_0, __IPHONE_4_0);

        and is described with:

            for (n = 0; n < N; ++n)
                C[n] = A[n] + B[n];

        The pseudocode uses two important simplifications:

            Names are shortened.

                The prefix "__" is removed.  This prefix is used in this
                header file so that Apple parameter names do not conflict with
                other developer macro names that might be used in source files
                that include this header, as when a program might use "#define
                N 1024" to set a preprocessor macro "N" to expand to "1024".

            Vectors are simplified by omitting strides.

                The parameters A and IA (with the prefix omitted) represent a
                vector with its elements at memory locations A[i*IA], for
                appropriate values of i.  In the pseudocode, the stride IA
                is omitted; the vector is treated as a simple mathematical
                vector with elements A[i].

                This default map is assumed for all vDSP routines unless stated
                otherwise.  An array without a stride parameter has unit
                stride.  Some routines have more complicated maps.  These are
                documented with each routine.

    Default maps:

        These default maps are used unless documented otherwise for a routine.
        For real vectors:

            Pseudocode:     Memory:
            C[n]            C[n*IC]

        For complex vectors:

            Pseudocode:     Memory:
            C[n]            C->realp[n*IC] + i * C->imagp[n*IC]

        Observe that C[n] in the pseudocode is a complex number, with a real
        component and an imaginary component.


    Pseudocode:

        The pseudo-code used to describe routines is largely C with some
        additions:

            e, pi, and i are the usual mathematical constants, approximately
            2.71828182845, 3.1415926535, and sqrt(-1).

            "**" is exponentiation.  3**4 is 81.

            Re and Im are the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
            Re(3+4*i) is 3, and Im(3+4*i) is 4.

            sum(f(j), 0 <= j < N) is the sum of f(j) evaluated for each integer
            j from 0 (inclusive) to N (exclusive).  sum(j**2, 0 <= j < 4) is
            0 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.  Multiple dimensions may be used.  Thus,
            sum(f(j, k), 0 <= j < M, 0 <= k < N) is the sum of f(j, k)
            evaluated for each pair of integers (j, k) satisfying the
            constraints.

            conj(z) is the complex conjugate of z (the imaginary part is
            negated).

            |x| is the absolute value of x.

   Exactness, IEEE 754 conformance:

        vDSP routines are not expected to produce results identical to the
        pseudo-code in the descriptions, because vDSP routines are free to
        rearrange calculations for better performance.  These rearrangements
        are mathematical identities, so they would produce identical results
        if exact arithmetic were used.  However, floating-point arithmetic
        is approximate, and the rounding errors will often be different when
        operations are rearranged.

        Generally, vDSP routines are not expected to conform to IEEE 754.
        Notably, results may be not correctly rounded to the last bit even for
        elementary operations, and operations involving infinities and NaNs may
        be handled differently than IEEE 754 specifies.

    Const:

        vDSP does not modify the contents of input arrays (including input
        scalars passed by address).  If the specification of a routine does not
        state that it alters the memory that a parameter points to, then the
        routine does not alter that memory through that parameter.  (It may of
        course alter the same memory if it is also pointed to by an output
        parameter.  Such in-place operation is permitted for some vDSP routines
        and not for others.)

        Unfortunately, C semantics make it impractical to add "const" to
        pointers inside structs, because such structs are type-incompatible
        with structs containing pointers that are not const.  Thus, vDSP
        routines with complex parameters accept those parameters via
        DSPSplitComplex and DSPDoubleSplitComplex structs (among other types)
        and not via const versions of those structures.

    Strides:

        (Note:  This section introduces strides.  For an issue using strides
        with complex data, see "Complex strides" below.)

        Many vDSP routines use strides, which specify that the vector operated
        on is embedded in a larger array in memory.  Consider an array A of
        1024 elements.  Then:

            Passing a vDSP routine:     Says to operate on:

            Address A and stride 1      Each element A[j]

            Address A and stride 2      Every other element, A[j*2]

            Address A+1 and stride 2    Every other element, starting
                                        with A[1], so A[j*2+1]

        Strides may be used to operate on columns of multi-dimensional arrays.
        For example, consider a 32*64 element array, A[32][64].  Then passing
        address A+13 and stride 64 instructs vDSP to operate on the elements of
        column 13.

        When strides are used, generally there is some accompanying parameter
        that specifies the length of the operation.  This length is typically
        the number of elements to be processed, not the number in the larger
        array.  (Some vDSP routines have interactions between parameters so
        that the length may specify some number of output elements but requires
        a different numbe of input elements.  This is documented with each
        routine.)

    Complex strides:

        Strides with complex data (interleaved complex data, not split
        complex data) are complicated by a legacy issue.  Originally, complex
        data was regarded as an array of individual elements, so that memory
        containing values to represent complex numbers 2 + 3i, 4 + 5i, 6 + 7i,
        and so on, contained individual floating-point elements:

            A[0] A[1] A[2] A[3] A[4] A[5]
             2    3    4    5    6    7  

        This arrangement was said to have a stride of two, indicating that a
        new complex number starts every two elements.  In the modern view, we
        would regard this as an array of struct with a stride of one struct.
        Unfortunately, the vDSP interface is bound by requirements of backward
        compatibility and must retain the original use.

        Adding to this issue, a parameter is declared as a pointer to DSPComplex
        or DSPDoubleComplex (both structures of two floating-point elements),
        but its stride is still passed as a stride of floating-point elements.
        This means that, in C, to refer to complex element i of a vector C with
        stride IC, you must divide the stride by 2, using C[i*IC/2].
        Essentially, the floating-point element stride passed to the vDSP
        routine, IA, should be twice the complex-number struct stride.

        If Direction is +1, a real-to-complex transform is performed, taking
        input from a real vector that has been coerced into the complex
        structure:

            scale = 2;

            // Define a real vector, h:
            for (j = 0; j < N/2; ++j)

                h[2*j + 1] = C->imagp[j*IC];
            }

            // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
            for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
                H[k] = scale *
                    sum(h[j] * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j*k/N), 0 <= j < N);

            // Pack DC and Nyquist components into C->realp[0] and C->imagp[0].
            C->realp[0*IC] = Re(H[ 0 ]).
            C->imagp[0*IC] = Re(H[N/2]).

            // Store regular components:
            for (k = 1; k < N/2; ++k)
            {
                C->realp[k*IC] = Re(H[k]);
                C->imagp[k*IC] = Im(H[k]);
            }

            Note that, for N/2 < k < N, H[k] is not stored.  However, since
            the input is a real vector, the output has symmetry that allows the
            unstored elements to be derived from the stored elements:  H[k] =
            conj(H(N-k)).  This symmetry also implies the DC and Nyquist
            components are real, so their imaginary parts are zero.

        If Direction is -1, a complex-to-real inverse transform is performed,
        producing a real output vector coerced into the complex structure:

            scale = 1./N;

            // Define a complex vector, h:
            h[ 0 ] = C->realp[0*IC];
            h[N/2] = C->imagp[0*IC];
            for (j = 1; j < N/2; ++j)
            {
                h[ j ] = C->realp[j*IC] + i * C->imagp[j*IC];
                h[N-j] = conj(h[j]);
            }

            // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
            for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
                H[k] = scale *
                    sum(h[j] * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j*k/N), 0 <= j < N);

            // Coerce real results into complex structure:
            for (k = 0; k < N/2; ++k)
            {
                C->realp[k*IC] = H[2*k+0];
                C->imagp[k*IC] = H[2*k+1];
            }

            Note that, mathematically, the symmetry in the input vector compels
            every H[k] to be real, so there are no imaginary components to be
            stored.

        Setup must have been properly created by a call to vDSP_create_fftsetup
        (for single precision) or vDSP_create_fftsetupD (for double precision)
        and not subsequently destroyed.

        Direction must be +1 or -1.

        The temporary buffer versions perform the same operation but are

        of Buffer->realp and Buffer->imagp must contain N/2 * sizeof *C->realp
        bytes and is preferably 16-byte aligned or better.

        If Direction is +1, a real-to-complex transform is performed, taking

            }

            // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
            for (k1 = 0; k1 < N1; ++k1)
            for (k0 = 0; k0 < N0; ++k0)
                H[k1][k0] = scale * sum(sum(h[j1][j0]
                    * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j0*k0/N0), 0 <= j0 < N0)
                    * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j1*k1/N1), 0 <= j1 < N1);

            // Pack special pure-real elements into output matrix:

            C->imagp[0*IC1][0*IC0] = H[0   ][N0/2]
            C->realp[1*IC1][0*IC0] = H[N1/2][0   ].
            C->imagp[1*IC1][0*IC0] = H[N1/2][N0/2]

            // Pack two vectors into output matrix "vertically":
            // (This awkward format is due to a legacy implementation.)

            {
                C->realp[(2*k1+0)*IC1][0*IC0] = Re(H[k1][0   ]);
                C->realp[(2*k1+1)*IC1][0*IC0] = Im(H[k1][0   ]);

            Many elements of H are not stored.  However, since the input is a
            real matrix, H has symmetry that makes all the unstored elements of
            H functions of the stored elements of H.  So the data stored in C
            has complete information about the transform result.

        If Direction is -1, a complex-to-real inverse transform is performed,
        producing a real output vector coerced into the complex structure:

            scale = 1. / (N1*N0);

            // Define a complex matrix, h, in multiple steps:

            // Unpack the special elements:

            h[0   ][N0/2] = A->imagp[0*IA1][0*IA0];
            h[N1/2][0   ] = A->realp[1*IA1][0*IA0];
            h[N1/2][N0/2] = A->imagp[1*IA1][0*IA0];

            // Unpack the two vectors from "vertical" storage:
            for (j1 = 1; j1 < N1/2; ++j1)
            {
                h[j1][0   ] = A->realp[(2*j1+0)*IA1][0*IA0]

                h[j1][N0/2] = A->imagp[(2*j1+0)*IA1][0*IA0]
                        + i * A->imagp[(2*j1+1)*IA1][0*IA0]
            }

            for (j1 = 0; j1 < N1  ; ++j1)
            for (j0 = 1; j0 < N0/2; ++j0)
            {

                         + i * A->imagp[j1*IA1 + j0*IA0];
                h[j1][N0-j0] = conj(h[j1][j0]);

                    * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j0*k0/N0), 0 <= j0 < N0)

        for (m = 0; m < M; ++m)
        {

            If Direction is +1, a real-to-complex transform is performed,
            taking input from a real vector that has been coerced into the
            complex structure:

                scale = 2;

                // Define a real vector, h:
                for (j = 0; j < N/2; ++j)
                {
                    h[2*j + 0] = C->realp[m*IM + j*IC];
                    h[2*j + 1] = C->imagp[m*IM + j*IC];
                }

                // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
                for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
                    H[k] = scale *
                        sum(h[j] * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j*k/N), 0 <= j < N);

                // Pack DC and Nyquist components into initial elements.
                C->realp[m*IM + 0*IC] = Re(H[ 0 ]).
                C->imagp[m*IM + 0*IC] = Re(H[N/2]).

                // Store regular components:
                for (k = 1; k < N/2; ++k)
                {
                    C->realp[m*IM + k*IC] = Re(H[k]);
                    C->imagp[m*IM + k*IC] = Im(H[k]);
                }

                Note that, for N/2 < k < N, H[k] is not stored.  However, since
                the input is a real vector, the output has symmetry that allows
                the unstored elements to be derived from the stored elements:
                H[k] = conj(H(N-k)).  This symmetry also implies the DC and
                Nyquist components are real, so their imaginary parts are zero.

            If Direction is -1, a complex-to-real inverse transform is
            performed, producing a real output vector coerced into the complex
            structure:

                scale = 1./N;

                // Define a complex vector, h:
                h[ 0 ] = C->realp[m*IM + 0*IC];
                h[N/2] = C->imagp[m*IM + 0*IC];
                for (j = 1; j < N/2; ++j)
                {
                    h[ j ] = C->realp[m*IM + j*IC] + i * C->imagp[m*IM + j*IC];
                    h[N-j] = conj(h[j]);
                }

                // Perform Discrete Fourier Transform.
                for (k = 0; k < N; ++k)
                    H[k] = scale *
                        sum(h[j] * e**(-Direction*2*pi*i*j*k/N), 0 <= j < N);

                // Coerce real results into complex structure:
                for (k = 0; k < N/2; ++k)
                {
                    C->realp[m*IM + k*IC] = H[2*k+0];
                    C->imagp[m*IM + k*IC] = H[2*k+1];
                }

                Note that, mathematically, the symmetry in the input vector
                compels every H[k] to be real, so there are no imaginary
                components to be stored.

        }

        Setup must have been properly created by a call to vDSP_create_fftsetup
        (for single precision) or vDSP_create_fftsetupD (for double precision)

/*  How to use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Cosine
    Transform (DCT) interfaces.

    There are three steps to performing a DFT or DCT:

        Call a setup routine (e.g., vDSP_DFT_zop_CreateSetup) to get a setup
        object.

            This is a preparation step to be done when a program is starting or
            is starting some new phase (e.g., when a communication channel is
            opened).  It should never be done during real-time processing.  The
            setup routine is slow and is called only once to prepare data that
            can be used many times.

        Call an execution routine (e.g., vDSP_DFT_Execute or vDSP_DCT_Execute)
        to perform a DFT or DCT, and pass it the setup object.

            The execution routine is fast (for selected cases) and is generally
            called many times.

        Call a destroy routine (e.g., vDSP_DFT_DestroySetup) to release the
        memory held by the setup object.

            This is done when a program is ending or is ending some phase.
            After calling a destroy routine, the setup data is no longer valid
            and should not be used.

    Discussion:

        The current sequences of setup, execution, destroy routines are:

            For single-precision (float):

                vDSP_DFT_zop_CreateSetup,
                vDSP_DFT_Execute,
                vDSP_DFT_DestroySetup.

                vDSP_DFT_zrop_CreateSetup,
                vDSP_DFT_Execute,
                vDSP_DFT_DestroySetup.

                vDSP_DCT_CreateSetup,
                vDSP_DCT_Execute,
                vDSP_DFT_DestroySetup.

                vDSP_DFT_CreateSetup,
                vDSP_DFT_zop,
                vDSP_DFT_DestroySetup.

            For double-precision (double):

                vDSP_DFT_zop_CreateSetupD,
                vDSP_DFT_ExecuteD,
                vDSP_DFT_DestroySetupD.

                vDSP_DFT_zrop_CreateSetupD,
                vDSP_DFT_ExecuteD,
                vDSP_DFT_DestroySetupD.

        Sharing DFT and DCT setups:

            Any setup returned by a DFT or DCT setup routine may be passed as
            input to any DFT or DCT setup routine for the same precision (float
            or double), in the parameter named Previous.  (This allows the
            setups to share data, avoiding unnecessary duplication of some
            setup data.)  Setup routines may be executed in any order.  Passing
            any setup of a group of setups sharing data will result in a new
            setup sharing data with all of the group.

            When calling an execution routine, each setup can be used only with
            its intended execution routine.  Thus the setup returned by
            vDSP_DFT_CreateSetup can only be used with vDSP_DFT_zop and not
            with vDSP_DFT_Execute.

            vDSP_DFT_DestroySetup is used to destroy any single-precision DFT
            or DCT setup.  vDSP_DFT_DestroySetupD is used to destroy any
            double-precision DFT or DCT setup.

        History:

            vDSP_DFT_CreateSetup and vDSP_DFT_zop are the original vDSP DFT
            routines.  vDSP_DFT_zop_CreateSetup, vDSP_DFT_zrop_CreateSetup, and
            vDSP_DFT_Execute are newer, more specialized DFT routines.  These
            newer routines do not have stride parameters (stride is one) and
            incorporate the direction parameter into the setup.  This reduces
            the number of arguments passed to the execution routine, which
            receives only the setup and four address parameters.  Additionally,
            the complex-to-complex DFT (zop) and real-to-complex DFT (zrop) use
            the same execution routine (the setup indicates which function to
            perform).

            We recommend you use vDSP_DFT_zop_CreateSetup,
            vDPS_DFT_zrop_CreateSetup, and vDSP_DFT_Execute, and that you not
            use vDSP_DFT_CreateSetup and vDSP_DFT_zop.

    Multithreading:

        Never call a setup or destroy routine in a thread when any DFT or DCT
        routine (setup, execution, or destroy) that shares setup data may be
        executing.  (This applies not just to multiple threads but also to
        calling DFT or DCT routines in signal handlers.)

        Multiple DFT or DCT execution routines may be called simultaneously.
        (Their access to the setup data is read-only.)

        If you need to call setup and/or destroy routines while other DFT or
        DCT routines might be executing, you can either use Grand Central
        Dispatch or locks (costs time) to avoid simultaneous execution or you
        can create separate setup objects for them (costs memory).

    Parameters:

        vDSP_DFT_Setup Previous

            Previous is either zero or a previous DFT or DCT setup.  If a
            previous setup is passed, the new setup will share data with the
            previous setup, if feasible (and with any other setups the previous

        vDSP_Length Length

            Length is the number of complex elements to be transformed.

    Return value:

        Zero is returned if memory is unavailable.

    The returned setup object may be used only with vDSP_DFT_zop for the length
    given during setup.  Unlike previous vDSP FFT routines, the setup may not

/*  vDSP_DFT_zop_CreateSetup is a DFT setup routine.  It creates a setup object
    for use with the vDSP_DFT_Execute execution routine, to perform a
    complex-to-complex DFT.

    Parameters:

        vDSP_DFT_Setup Previous

            Previous is either zero or a previous DFT or DCT setup.  If a
            previous setup is passed, the new setup will share data with the
            previous setup, if feasible (and with any other setups the previous
            setup shares with).  If zero is passed, the routine will allocate
            and initialize new memory.

        vDSP_Length Length

            Length is the number of complex elements to be transformed.

        vDSP_DFT_Direction Direction

            Transform direction, vDSP_DFT_FORWARD or vDSP_DFT_INVERSE.

    Return value:

        Zero is returned if memory is unavailable or if there is no
        implementation for the requested case.  Currently, the implemented
        cases are:

            Length = 2**n.

            Length = f * 2**n, where f is 3, 5, or 15 and 3 <= n.

        Additionally, it is recommended that the array addresses (passed to
        vDSP_DFT_Execute) be 16-byte aligned.  For other cases, performance may
        be slightly or greatly worse, depending on transform length and
        processor model.

    Function:

        When vDSP_DFT_Execute is called with a setup returned from this
        routine, it calculates:

            For 0 <= k < N,

                H[k] = sum(1**(S * j*k/N) * h[j], 0 <= j < N),

        where:

            N is the length given in the setup;

            h is the array of complex numbers specified by Ir and Ii when
            vDSP_DFT_Execute is called:

                for 0 <= j < N,
                    h[j] = Ir[j] + i * Ii[j];

            H is the array of complex numbers specified by Or and Oi when
            vDSP_DFT_Execute returns:

                for 0 <= k < N,
                    H[k] = Or[k] + i * Oi[k];

            S is -1 if Direction is vDSP_DFT_FORWARD and +1 if Direction is
            vDSP_DFT_INVERSE; and

            1**x is e**(2*pi*i*x).

    Performance:

        Performance is good when the array addresses (passed to
        vDSP_DFT_Execute) are 16-byte aligned.  Other alignments are supported,
        but performance may be significantly worse in some cases, depending on
        the processor model or the transform length (because different
        algorithms are used for different forms of transform length).

    In-Place Operation:

        Or may equal Ir and Oi may equal Ii (in the call to vDSP_DFT_Execute).
        Otherwise, no overlap of Or, Oi, Ir, and Ii is supported.

    The returned setup object may be used only with vDSP_DFT_Execute for the
    length given during setup.  Unlike previous vDSP FFT routines, the setup
    may not be used to execute transforms with shorter lengths.

    Do not call this routine while any DFT or DCT routine sharing setup data
    might be executing.

    real-to-complex DFT or a complex-to-real DFT.  Documentation below is
    written for vDSP_DFT_zrop_CreateSetup.  vDSP_DFT_CreateSetupD behaves the
    same way, with corresponding changes of the types, objects, and routines to
    the double-precision versions.

    Parameters:

        vDSP_DFT_Setup Previous

            Previous is either zero or a previous DFT or DCT setup.  If a
            previous setup is passed, the new setup will share data with the
            previous setup, if feasible (and with any other setups the previous
            setup shares with).  If zero is passed, the routine will allocate
            and initialize new memory.

        vDSP_Length Length

            Length is the number of real elements to be transformed (in a a
            forward, real-to-complex transform) or produced (in a reverse,
            complex-to-real transform).  Length must be even.

        vDSP_DFT_Direction Direction

            Transform direction, vDSP_DFT_FORWARD or vDSP_DFT_INVERSE.

    Return value:

        Zero is returned if memory is unavailable or if there is no
        implementation for the requested case.  Currently, the implemented
        cases are:

            Length = 2**n.

            Length = f * 2**n, where f is 3, 5, or 15 and 4 <= n.

        Additionally, it is recommended that the array addresses (passed to
        vDSP_DFT_Execute) be 16-byte aligned.  For other cases, performance may
        be slightly or greatly worse, depending on transform length and
        processor model.

    Function:

        When vDSP_DFT_Execute is called with a setup returned from this
        routine, it calculates:

            For 0 <= k < N,

                H[k] = C * sum(1**(S * j*k/N) * h[j], 0 <= j < N),

        where:

            N is the Length given in the setup;

            h is the array of numbers specified by Ir and Ii when
            vDSP_DFT_Execute is called (see "Data Layout" below);

            H is the array of numbers specified by Or and Oi when
            vDSP_DFT_Execute returns (see "Data Layout" below);

            C is 2 if Direction is vDSP_DFT_FORWARD and 1 if Direction is
            vDSP_DFT_INVERSE;

            S is -1 if Direction is vDSP_DFT_FORWARD and +1 if Direction is
            vDSP_DFT_INVERSE; and

            1**x is e**(2*pi*i*x).

        Data Layout:

            If Direction is vDSP_DFT_FORWARD, then:

                h is an array of real numbers, with its even-index elements
                stored in Ir and its odd-index elements stored in Ii:

                    For 0 <= j < N/2,
                        h[2*j+0] = Ir[j], and
                        h[2*j+1] = Ii[j].

                H is an array of complex numbers, stored in Or and Oi:

                    H[0  ] = Or[0].  (H[0  ] is pure real.)
                    H[N/2] = Oi[0].  (H[N/2] is pure real.)
                    For 1 < k < N/2,
                        H[k] = Or[k] + i * Oi[k].

                For N/2 < k < N, H[k] is not explicitly stored in memory but is
                known because it necessarily equals the conjugate of H[N-k],
                which is stored as described above.

            If Direction is vDSP_DFT_INVERSE, then the layouts of the input and
            output arrays are swapped.  Ir and Ii describe an input array with
            complex elements laid out as described above for Or and Oi.  When
            vDSP_DFT_Execute returns, Or and Oi contain a pure real array, with
            its even-index elements stored in Or and its odd-index elements in
            Oi.

    Performance:

        Performance is good when the array addresses (passed to
        vDSP_DFT_Execute) are 16-byte aligned.  Other alignments are supported,
        but performance may be significantly worse in some cases, depending on
        the processor model or the transform length (because different
        algorithms are used for different forms of transform length).

    In-Place Operation:

        Or may equal Ir and Oi may equal Ii (in the call to vDSP_DFT_Execute).
        Otherwise, no overlap of Or, Oi, Ir, and Ii is supported.

    The returned setup object may be used only with vDSP_DFT_Execute for the
    length given during setup.  Unlike previous vDSP FFT routines, the setup
    may not be used to execute transforms with shorter lengths.

    Do not call this routine while any DFT routine sharing setup data might be
    executing.

    Parameters:

        vDSP_DFT_Setup Setup

            Setup is the setup object to be released.  The object may have

/*  vDSP_DFT_zop is a DFT execution routine.  It performs a DFT, with the aid

    Parameters:

        vDSP_DFT_Setup Setup

            A setup object returned by a previous call to

        const float *Ir
        const float *Ii

            Pointers to real and imaginary components of input data.

        vDSP_Stride Is

            The number of physical elements from one logical input element to
            the next.

        float *Or
        float *Oi

            Pointers to space for real and imaginary components of output
            data.

            The input and output arrays may not overlap except as specified
            in "In-Place Operation", below.

            Transform direction, vDSP_DFT_FORWARD or vDSP_DFT_INVERSE.

    Observe there is no separate length parameter.  The length is passed via
    the setup object.

    Performance:

        Performance is good for these cases:

            All addresses are 16-byte aligned, all strides are one, and the
            length is f * 2**n, where f is 3, 5, or 15 and 3 <= n.

        Performance is extremely slow for all other cases.

    In-Place Operation:

        For cases where the length is f * 2**n, where f is 3, 5, or 15 and 3 <=
        n, Or may equal Ir and Oi may equal Ii.  Otherwise, no overlap of Or,
        Oi, Ir, and Ii is supported.

/*  vDSP_DCT_CreateSetup is a DCT setup routine.  It creates a setup object
    for use with the vDSP_DCT_Execute routine.  See additional information
    above, at "How to use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete
    Cosine Transform (DCT) interfaces."

    Parameters:

        vDSP_DFT_Setup Previous

            Previous is either zero or a previous DFT or DCT setup.  If a
            previous setup is passed, the new setup will share data with the
            previous setup, if feasible (and with any other setups the
            previous setup shares with).  If zero is passed, the routine
            will allocate and initialize new memory.

        vDSP_Length Length

            Length is the number of real elements to be transformed.

        vDSP_DCT_Type Type

            Type specifies which DCT variant to perform.  At present, the
            supported DCT types are II and III (which are mutual inverses, up
            to scaling) and IV (which is its own inverse).  These are specified
            with symbol names vDSP_DCT_II, vDSP_DCT_III, and vDSP_DCT_IV.

    Return value:

        Zero is returned if memory is unavailable or if there is no
        implementation for the requested case.  Currently, the implemented
        cases are:

            Length = f * 2**n, where f is 1, 3, 5, or 15 and 4 <= n.

    Function:

        When vDSP_DCT_Execute is called with a setup returned from this
        routine, it calculates:

            If Type is vDSP_DCT_II:

                For 0 <= k < N,

                    Or[k] = sum(Ir[j] * cos(k * (j+1/2) * pi / N, 0 <= j < N).

            If Type is vDSP_DCT_III

                For 0 <= k < N,

                    Or[k] = Ir[0]/2
                        + sum(Ir[j] * cos((k+1/2) * j * pi / N), 1 <= j < N).

            If Type is vDSP_DCT_IV:

                For 0 <= k < N,

                    Or[k] = sum(Ir[j] * cos((k+1/2) * (j+1/2) * pi / N, 0 <= j < N).

            Where:

                N is the length given in the setup,

                h is the array of real numbers passed to vDSP_DCT_Execute in
                Input, and

                H is the array of real numbers stored by vDSP_DCT_Execute in
                the array passed to it in Output.

     Performance:

        Performance is good when the array addresses (passed to
        vDSP_DFT_Execute) are 16-byte aligned.  Other alignments are supported,
        but performance may be significantly worse in some cases, depending on
        the processor model or the transform length (because different
        algorithms are used for different forms of transform length).

    In-Place Operation:

        Output may equal Input (in the call the vDSP_DCT_Execute).  Otherwise,
        no overlap is permitted between the two buffers.

    The returned setup object may be used only with vDSP_DCT_Execute for the
    length given during setup.

        Adds to O1 the product of I1 and a ramp function with initial value
        *Start and slope *Step.

    *Start is updated to continue the ramp in a consecutive call.  To continue
    the ramp smoothly, the new value of *Step includes rounding errors
    accumulated during the routine rather than being calculated directly as
    *Start + N * *Step.

    This routine calculates:

Following is a short description of functions in this section:
                                                                         
      Add:      It takes two vectors of data elements and adds each element         
                of the second vector to the corresponding element of the first      
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register.

      Subtract: It takes two vectors of data elements and subtracts each element    
                of the second vector from the corresponding element of the first    
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register.

      Multiply: It takes two vectors of data elements and multiplies each element   
                of the first vector by the corresponding element of the second      
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register. 

      Divide:   It takes two vectors of data elements and divides each element      
                of the first vector by the corresponding element of the second      
                vector and puts the result in the associated data element of the    
                destination register. A pointer is passed to the function to get   
                the remainder.

      Shift:    It takes a vector of two 64-bit data elements or one 128-bit
                data element and shifts it to right or left, in a logical or 
                algebraic manner, using a shift factor that is passed as an
                arguement to the function.

      Rotate:   It takes a vector of two 64-bit data elements or one 128-bit
                data element and rotates it to right or left, using a shift 
               factor that is passed as an arguement to the function.

 hints allow the user to pass useful information about the traits of the
 matrix.  Increasing the amount of information known about a matrix can in some
 cases improve performance.  Consider the extreme where a matrix is a diagonal
 matrix.  When multiplying this matrix with another, if it was not known to be
 diagonal the cost would be O(N^3) but the extra information allows the cost
 to drop to O(N^2).

 In many cases, the framework can inspect the data to determine this information
 when it is not made available by hint, but for certain traits, such as
 symmetric positive definiteness, this can be a costly operation, especially if
 the user already knows the trait to be true.

 These are however hints, an incorrect hint will not break the intended
 operation, in the worst case it adds overhead.  When in doubt, it is
 recommended that rather than guessing, if no information is known, use
 LA_NO_HINT.

 This function creates an object representing a matrix whose entries are
 copied out of the supplied buffer of floats.  Negative or zero strides
 are not supported by this function (but note that you can reverse the
 rows or columns using the la_matrix_slice function defined below).

 This routine assumes that the elements of the matrix are stored in the buffer
 in row-major order.  If you need to work with data that is in column-major
 order, you can do that as follows:

 1. Use this routine to create a matrix object, but pass the number of
 columns in your matrix for the matrix_rows parameter and vice-versa.  For
 the matrix_row_stride parameter, pass the column stride of your matrix.

 2. Make a new matrix transpose object from the object created in step 1.  The

 Splat objects are a feature that is relatively unique to the LinearAlgebra
 library.

 A splat object represents a matrix or vector whose entries are all equal.
 It may be used in the place of a matrix or vector in many computational
 operations in the library.

 Splat objects are effectively dimensionless matrices.  Computational
 operations that accept them interpret them as having dimensions necessary
 to be compatibile with the other operand.  Because the dimensions of a
 splat are inferred from the other operands, a single operation cannot
 have multiple splat operands.

 A partial list of operations accepting splat operands, and the rules for the
 inferred size:

 @abstract
 Solves a system of linear equations
 
 @param matrix_system
 A matrix describing the left-hand side of the system.
 
 @param obj_rhs
 A vector or matrix describing one or more right-hand sides for which the
 equations are to be solved.
 
 @return
 A matrix of the solution(s) of the system of equations.

 @discussion
 If matrix_system represents a matrix A, and obj_rhs represents a vector
 B, la_solve returns a vector X representing a solution to the equation
 AX = B, if such a solution exists.  If obj_rhs represents a matrix, then
 la_solve returns a matrix representing the solution of the same equation.
 
 There are several different cases, and different algorithms are chosen
 depending on the specifics:
 
 If the matrix has a special structure that allows us to solve the system
 without factoring (e.g. if the matrix is diagonal or triangular), we may
 use that structure to compute the solution.
 
 If the matrix is symmetric and all diagonal entries are positive, or if we
 know, either via a hint parameter or by how earlier computations were
 structured, that the matrix is positive definite, we attempt a Cholesky
 factorization.  If this succeeds, it is used to compute the solution via
 forward- and back-substitution.
 
 If the matrix is square, we try to perform Gaussian elimination to construct
 a triangular factorization with pivoting.  If this factorization succeeds,
 we use it to solve the system.  If it fails, the returned object has the
 error status LA_SINGULAR_ERROR.
 
 If the matrix is not square, we return a least-squares solution computed by
 performing a QR factorization of the matrix.
 
 If the number of rows of the matrix does not match the number of rows of
 the right hand side object, the returned object has status 
 LA_DIMENSION_MISMATCH_ERROR.
 
 If the object describing the matrix is not a matrix, or if the right hand
 side is not a matrix or vector, the returned object has status
 LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.
 
 If you want to solve the system XA = B, which is less common (but still
 occurs fairly frequently), you may accomplish this by transposing A and B,
 solving, and then transposing the result of the solve.

 @abstract
 Type used by all functions in the LinearAlgebra library.

 @discussion LinearAlgebra objects behave rather differently depending on 
 whether you are writing Objective-C or C.  For details of semantics and memory 
 management consult the appropriate section below.  For further information, 
 consult the comments in <os/object.h>.

 Objective-C with ARC:
 LinearAlgebra objects are objective-c objects.  This means that
 they participate in ARC, may be used with collections, etc.  Thus, if you are 
 using ARC, you must not retain or release LinearAlgebra objects; the compiler 
 will take care of it for you.

 Objective-C without ARC:
 If you are not using ARC, you send -[retain] and -[release] messages to
 LinearAlgebra objects, just like you would with objects of any other 
 Objective-C type.

 C:
 LinearAlgebra objects are reference counted and must be retained and released
 via the la_retain( ) and la_release( ) functions.  Do not attempt to
 call free( ) on LinearAlgebra objects; this will typically result in leaks.

 The status of the supplied object.

 @discussion Returns the status of a LinearAlgebra object.  The status will be 
 one of the codes defined in LinearAlgebra/base.h.  New status codes may be
 added in the future, but the following basic principle will continue to hold: 
 zero indicates success, status codes greater than zero are warnings, and
 status codes less than zero are errors.  Thus, careful error handling
 might look like the following:

 <pre>
 @textblock
 la_status_t status = la_status(result_object);
 if (status == LA_SUCCESS) {
    // Everything is copacetic.  Get your data from result_object.
 } else if (status > 0) {
    // No errors occured, but the result does not have full accuracy due to
    // numerical considerations.  Here, you might re-compute the result using
    // a more careful or stable algorithm.
 } else {
    // An error occured.  Something is seriously amiss and you will need
    // to handle it however makes sense for your application.
 }
 @/textblock
 </pre>

 Note that errors and warnings are propagated.  In general, there is no need
 to check the status of each subcomputation.  Rather, the preferred idiom is
 to do a complete computation, then check to see if anything went wrong.
 Querying status may force evaluation of parts of your computation that might
 otherwise be deferred until their results were actually needed.

 @abstract
 Status codes for la_object_t objects.

 @discussion
 Every la_object_t object has a status.  If everything has gone well in a
 computation, the status will be LA_STATUS_SUCCESS, which is defined to
 be zero.  Status codes greater than zero indicate warnings, and codes less
 than zero indicate errors.

 Errors and warnings propagate with a computation to all descendants of the
 la_object_t object that produced them.  If a la_object_t object receives an 
 error or warning from both parents, one of them will take precedence over the
 other.  The exact precedence ranking is not defined, but errors always
 supercede warnings.

 @constant LA_SUCCESS
 There are no errors or warnings associated with the la_object_t object.

 @constant LA_WARNING_POORLY_CONDITIONED
 One or more parts of the computation was poorly conditioned numerically, and
 the results are signficantly less accurate than might otherwise expected.

 @constant LA_INTERNAL_ERROR
 An error was encountered internal to the LinearAlgebra library.  For example, 
 an allocation failed, or memory was corrupted.

 @constant LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR
 An invalid parameter was passed to the function that created this object or
 one of it's ancestors.

 @constant LA_DIMENSION_MISMATCH_ERROR
 The function that created this object or one of its ancestors was passed
 arguments whose dimensions were not compatibile.  For example, this error
 might be generated by attempting to add a 63-element vector to a 135-element
 vector, or to multiply a 10x4 matrix by a 7x128 matrix.

 @constant LA_PRECISION_MISMATCH_ERROR
 The function that created this object or one of its ancestors was passed
 arguments whose underlying scalar types did not match.

 @constant LA_SINGULAR_ERROR
 One or more parts of the computation attempted to solve a singular system,
 and no correct result is possible.

 @discussion

 These sparse BLAS routines provide access to sparse computation while hiding
 the details of the sparse matrix storage formats.
 
 A brief note on the naming convention used.  When an operation has two 
 operands, if both operands are sparse then _sparse_ will be in the name, but if
 one operand is sparse and the other dense, then _dense_ will be in the name.  
 For example, sparse_inner_product_sparse_float is a sparse-sparse operation and 
 sparse_inner_product_dense_float is a sparse-dense operation.  Any operation that 
 has a single matrix or vector is going to be operating on sparse structures and 
 no _dense_ or _sparse_ is added to the name.
 
 This sparse BLAS package utilizes a compressed form vector where two storage 
 arrays of the same size are used, the first to store the nonzero values of the 
 vector, the other to store the index of the nonzero values.  For example, for
 the dense vector:
 
 d = [3, 0, 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 0, 0]
 
 the sparse vector will be stored as two arrays:
 
 s =     [3, 7, 9, 4]
 
 sindx = [0, 3, 4, 6]
 
 These two arrays hold their values as consecutive elements and are referred to
 throughout the documentation as the dense storage of the sparse vector.
 
 Indices are always assumed to be stored in ascending order. Additionally, 
 indices are assumed to be unique.  Undefined behavior if either of these 
 assumptions are not met.
 
 All indices are 0 based (the first element of a pointer is ptr[0]).
 
 Due to the variety of sparse matrix representations, the details of the storage
 format are hidden from the developer.  There are however two general flavors;
 point wise and block wise storage.
 
 With a point wise format, individual elements are stored within the matrix 
 representation. Point wise formats allow for adding single (val,i,j) values,
 collections of (val,i,j) values, or sparse vectors as a row or column.
 
 With block wise storage formats, blocks of elements are stored within the 
 matrix. Block formats allow for adding blocks of values at specified block 
 indices. For example if block sizes are constant, adding the K x L block to the 
 matrix at block location bi,bj will add values to 
 matrix[bi*K:bi*K+K-1,bj*L:bj*L-1]. With block storage formats, block sizes can 
 either be uniform throughout the matrix, or variable based on row and column 
 location.
 
 Beyond selecting a point wise or block wise format, the matrix storage format 
 is hidden from the developer.
 
 Matrix objects must be memory managed.  They are created with a create routine,
 used to completion, and then must be destroyed to release any associated
 memory.  The typical work flow is as follows:
 
 <pre>
 // Create matrix object and check for error
 sparse_matrix_float A = sparse_matrix_create_float(40,40);
 if ( !A ) { // handle error }
 
 // Insert values from existing arrays values, iIndx, and jIndx
 // Then check for error
 if ( sparse_insert_entry_float( A, 12, values, iIndx, jIndx ) ) { // handle error }
 
 // Perform computation
 float nrm = sparse_matrix_norm_float( A, SPARSE_NORM_INF );
 
 // Clean up
 sparse_matrix_destroy( A );
 </pre>
 
 Since data insertion into the internal storage is very expensive, caused by data
 movement and possible memory allocation, data insertion functions do not update
 the internal storage immediately. Rather, all data insertions are put into a pending
 queue. The internal storage is then updated automatically when required by the BLAS
 operations, or explicitly triggered by calling sparse_commit().
 
 When commit is triggered automatically by the BLAS operation, expect the operation
 to take longer time. If this is undesirable, consider calling sparse_commit() in a
 less time-sensitive code segment.

 individual values are stored for a given i,j location as opposed to blocks of

 @abstract
 Use to build a sparse matrix by providing a dense block for entry at block
 location A[bi,bj].  Block size is determined at object creation time.  A must
 have been created with one of sparse_matrix_block_create_float,
 sparse_matrix_block_create_double, sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_float, or
 sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_double.
 
 @param A
 The sparse matrix.  A must have been created with one of 
 sparse_matrix_block_create_float, sparse_matrix_block_create_double, 
 sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_float, or 
 sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_double.  SPARSE_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER is returned if 
 not met.  A holds block dimensions (fixed or variable) set with matrix object 
 creation routine.
 
 @param val
 Pointer to block to be inserted at block index location A[bi,bj].  The block is
 of dimension k x l where k and l are set for bi,bj at object creation time.  
 The strides between elements for rows and columns are provided in row_stride 
 and col_stride.
 
 @param row_stride
 The row stride in number of elements to move from one row to the next for the
 block val.
 
 @param col_stride
 The column stride in number of elements to move from one column to the next for
 the block val.
 
 @param bi
 The block row index where val is to be inserted.  Indexing is zero based, the
 first block is located at 0,0.  Index is assumed to be within the bounds of the
 matrix object, undefined behavior if not met.
 
 @param bj
 The block column index where val is to be inserted.  Indexing is zero based, the
 first block is located at 0,0.  Index is assumed to be within the bounds of the
 matrix object, undefined behavior if not met.
 
 @result
 On successful insertion, A has been updated with the value and SPARSE_SUCCESS is
 returned.  If A creation requirements are not met, SPARSE_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER is
 returned and A is unchanged.
 
 @discussion
 Use to build a sparse matrix by providing a dense block for entry at block
 location A[bi,bj].  Block size is determined at object creation time.  Given a
 block dimension of k x l and for location bi,bj, update as:
 A[bi,bj][i,j] = val[i*row_stride + j*col_stride] for each i in k and each j in
 l.  
 
 A must have been created with one of sparse_matrix_block_create_float,
 sparse_matrix_block_create_double, sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_float, or
 sparse_matrix_variable_block_create_double.
 
 Note that matrix properties cannot be modified after value insertion begins.
 This includes properties such as specifying a triangular matrix.
 
 Insertion can be expensive, generally speaking it is best to do a batch update.
 Inserted values may be temporarily held internally within the object and only
 inserted into the sparse format when a later computation triggers a need to
 insert.

 *
 * where A and B are optionally transposed as indicated by the value of transA
 * and transB.  This is a surprisingly useful operation; although its function
 * is fairly trivial, efficient implementation has enough subtlety to justify
 * a library interface.
 *
 * As an added convenience, this function supports in-place operation for
 * square matrices; in-place operation for non-square matrices in the face of
 * transposition is a subtle problem outside the scope of this interface.
 * In-place operation is only supported if the leading dimensions match as well
 * as the pointers.  If C overlaps A or B but does not have equal leading
 * dimension, or does not exactly match the source that it overlaps, the
 * behavior of this function is undefined.
 *
 * If alpha or beta is zero, then A (or B, respectively) is ignored entirely,
 * meaning that the memory is not accessed and the data does not contribute
 * to the result (meaning you can pass B == NULL if beta is zero).
 *
 * Note that m and n are the number of rows and columns of C, respectively.
 * If either A or B is transposed, then they are interpreted as n x m matrices.
